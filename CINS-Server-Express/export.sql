48	2012-09-26 16:00:00	cpp-netlib: HTTP API Plans Update; Part II - Current Issues	Yesterday's article was an abbreviated history of the cpp-netlib project. Before I go into greater detail on the planned HTTP API updates (see the document here) I'll write about what the current challenges are with the library and getting changes in and a little about what we're doing to address these short-comings. This is part two of a three-part series that aims to highlight the work that's gone into the library and how it's going to change moving forward. The next part will cover the details of future work on the project as far as HTTP is concerned among other initiatives as well.Given the history of the project, it's been evolving from simple to a little more complex and back to simple again. The strains encountered in the internal design have mostly not manifested in the API -- thankfully we've been able to keep the API of the client implementation stable across three releases. I think we've been very lucky to be able to do that because we've kept the API as simple and straight-forward as possible.Unfortunately though the requirements on modern C++ applications have since changed from 2007. More and more resources are moving to HTTP-based APIs for good reason: HTTP is a ubiquitously supported in most modern programming languages either as primitives (or close to primitives, as in JavaScript) or as part of a standard library. It's also traditionally (and continues to be) the most allowed protocol through multiple layers of security. It is simple and applies very well to a whole host of programming patterns involving remote resources and sometimes data interchange (you may want to look up REST APIs to get a feel for what I mean).Another thing that happened since 2007 was the focus on multi-threaded programming and the acknowledgement that the future is increasingly concurrent and parallel in C++. The C++11 standard defines a memory model and standard libraries for threading in C++ which makes concurrent programs the majority of programs written going forward. A whole host of libraries came out like Intel's Threading Building Blocks which focuses on getting foundational algorithms and data structures that leverage the new multi-core architectures and multi-threaded programming paradigms.The combination of a want to support fully asynchronous I/O models along with the pressures of supporting threads and synchronization primitives in a standard manner has meant that the current API for HTTP clients and servers in cpp-netlib are no longer "modern". For a library claiming to want to provide modern C++ usage semantics, it's not doing a good job of exposing an API that lives up to the modern standard.Other issues being encountered is still the inherent and apparent disarray of the implementation since it has evolved from a purely blocking (read: non-asynchronous or synchronous) model to one that's mixed the concept of sync and async APIs together. Because of the desire to support both sync and async modes the APIs become neither -- and thus supporting more features means a lot more work than necessary. The poor organization and documentation of internals also makes it really hard for someone new to the project to get up and hacking on the internals.Even though most of the template metaprogramming has gone, the types in cpp-netlib are still templates. However though it's been really hard to keep the API stable with the move from header-only to non-header-only as some interfaces needed to become non-templates. Parts that used to be exclusively static that didn't need to be purely static have been migrated to becoming dynamic interfaces. Things like determining the behavior of a connection based on the URI -- should be using an encrypted socket (SSL) or not and whether the response should be handled as HTTP 1.0 or HTTP 1.1 just to give a couple of examples.Initial attempts at providing an API for handling the body response chunk-by-chunk but not as part of the response object was a very bad design decision. It broke the simplicity of the API and it introduced a point of complexity where it shouldn't have had to be there in the first place.This is the client side only though -- the server side had its fair share of problems design-wise.The purely synchronous (but thread-aware) version of the server implementation suffered the same problem -- because it defined the handler interface as a generic but static&nbsp;concept-based approach, most of the required details of modern HTTP 1.1 implementations couldn't be introduced easily. Because the server was designed to be very generic, it couldn't get most of the usual details right. I'm talking about things like session management, supporting request queue limits, supporting HTTP/1.1 pipelining, among other things. Even though I've implemented these things before in a proprietary implementation, I didn't have to think about external usage scenarios.The server also suffered from the sync/async split. Because precisely of the generic API that simplified (too much to a fault, using the wrong abstractions) handler implementations, things like sessions couldn't be made part of the library implementation right away. There also was not a way to get request handlers to write chunks out to the connection, since the API was fully synchronous. The implementation then of the synchronous and asynchronous servers diverged greatly and the maintenance burden of supporting one feature in one implementation while not supporting it in another has literally doubled.These factors have contributed to the acceptance and recognition that the current interface and implementation are insufficient -- that they cannot really be just evolved incrementally from the current state to a future state. Supporting the synchronous implementation no longer makes sense in this world of C++11 where concurrency is a first-class citizen and that asynchronous operation is the norm. The API is seriously hampered flexibility-wise because C++03 didn't support enum classes -- for example we made a choice to just support GET, PUT, POST, DELETE, and HEAD as member functions, instead of providing a request function that took type-safe enums that determined statically which request implementation to pick.A wanting to leverage the dynamic nature of HTTP request/response handling also influenced the direction of both the client API as well as the server API. C++11 has lambdas and they are powerful for defining not only completion handlers (or callbacks) to support real streaming, but it also provides a more localized and simpler handler implementation. With the help of real modern C++ design idioms (policy classes, dependency injection, configuration patterns, and scalable error handling, etc.) I'm personally looking forward to rationalize and greatly improve the facilities available when doing HTTP server-side C++ development.In the next part of the series I dive into the API changes and the explanation to some idioms and patterns that recur in the new design. I also tackle the direction that the project is taking and how you can help the team achieve even more ambitious goals.\r\n             \r\n	Cpp Soup	http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/CppSoup/~3/Ka0jhCOkme0/cpp-netlib-http-api-plans-update-part.html	Article	3

65	2017-01-06 00:00:00	Folding Monadic Functions	\n\nIn the previous two blog posts (Understanding Fold Expressions and Folding Functions) we looked at the basic usage of C++17 fold expressions and how simple functions can be folded to create a composite one. We’ll continue our stride and see how "embellished" functions may be composed in fold expressions. \n\nFirst, let me define what I mean by embellished functions. Instead of just returning a simple value, these functions are going to return a generic container of the desired value. The choice of container is very broad but not arbitrary. There are some constraints on the container and once you select a generic container, all functions must return values of the same container. Let's begin with std::vector. \n \n\n// Hide the allocator template argument of std::vector. \n// It causes problems and is irrelevant here.\ntemplate \nstruct Vector : std::vector {};\n\nstruct Continent { };\nstruct Country { };\nstruct State { };\nstruct City { }; \n\nauto get_countries = [](Continent& c) -> Vector { return ... } ;\nauto get_states    = [](Country& c)   -> Vector   { return ... };\nauto get_cities    = [](State& s)     -> Vector    { return ... };\n\n\nThe focus of this post is folding functions like get_countries, get_states, and get_cities. As you may have noted, these functions are different from what we saw in the previous post. They don’t readily compose. The return types and argument types don’t line up. But I bet you know how to get to the cities given a Continent. Don’t you? Hold on to that intuition. It will come in handy later. In essence, my attempt is going to formalize that intuition of yours while generalizing it by leaps and bounds. Possibly, beyond recognition. \n\nOur target here is to enable folding (a.k.a. composition) of these embellished functions similar to the compose function we saw in the previous post. We’ll call it composeM though.\n\n\nContinent c;\nauto cities_from_continent = composeM(get_countries, get_states, get_cities);\nVector cities = cities_from_continent(c);\n\n \nLet’s begin by implementing composeM using a unary left fold. Let’s use the >>= operator because we can. Of course, we’ll also need to overload >>= for our embellished functions.\n\n\ntemplate \nauto composeM(Args&&... args)\n{\n  return (... >>= args);\n}\n\ntemplate \nauto operator >>= (F&& f, G&& g)\n{\n  using FArg = arg_type_t;\n  using GResult = result_type_t;\n\n  return [f,g] (FArg a) -> GResult {\n      using FResult = result_type_t;\n      GResult finalvec;\n      FResult const & fvec = f(a);\n      for(const auto& o: fvec) {\n        const GResult& gvec = g(o);\n        finalvec.insert(finalvec.end(), gvec.begin(), gvec.end());\n      }\n      return finalvec;\n  };\n}\n\nWhat a nasty function is that!?\n\nNow would be a good time to recall the intuition you had about going from a Continent to it's cities. Your intuition about implementing cities_from_continent is probably as follows. This algorithm goes all three levels in one function (with three nested loops).\n\nGet a Continent from somewhere. Initialize an empty vector of cities.\nCall get_countries (level 1)\nCall get_states for each country (level 2)\nCall get_cities for each state (level 3) and push_back in the vector of cities\nReturn the vector of cities\n\nOn the other hand, the overloaded >>= function implements the same intuition with only two levels at a time (as it accepts only two functions as parameters). Going three levels requires operator >>= to be called twice. C++ compiler will do that for us because we're using the fold expression in composeM. Every time compiler calls operator >>= it returns a function that's just like it received as arguments. Specifically, the returned closure is not a generic. We find out the argument type of F (FArg) and result type of G (GResult) and use them in the definition of the lambda. The returned closure is a composite because it accepts F's argument type and returns G's result type. It glues F and G together. All that ceremony is kinda important.\n\nWhen operator >>= is called the first time, F is of type Continent→Vector (i.e., get_countries) and G is of type Country→Vector (i.e., get_states). The first time around, the signature of the closure is going to be Continent→Vector. It's just "like" the other two. Naturally, when this closure is composed with get_cities, operator >>= works smoothly and returns a closure of type Continent→Vector, which is exactly the same as cities_from_continent you intuitively had in mind. \n\nAn important difference between the direct function and the function that's the result of composition is that the composed version materializes (creates) a temporary vector every time operator >>= is called. That's an overhead. There are ways to avoid that but we may have to consider something other than std::vector. I won't discuss that here. See Range-v3. \n\nAnother Example: boost::future\n\nSo far we've looked at composition of embellished functions that accept an argument and return a vector of some type. At the beginning of the article, I suggested that there is broad set of generic containers we can choose from. Now would be a good time to select another one. How a about boost::future? We'll go through a similar exercise of compositing function that return boost::future. We'll see if there's anything common in the composition of functions that return vectors and functions that return futures.\n\nLet's imagine there's a database that contains information about the largest countries, states, and cities in the world. As database operations are i/o bound, using futures to communicate the possibility of long execution times is a good idea. So our function look like as follows.\n\nauto get_largest_country = [](Continent const &) -> boost::future { ... };\nauto get_largest_state   = [](Country const &)   -> boost::future   { ... };\nauto get_largest_city    = [](State const &)     -> boost::future    { ... }\n\nIf we need the largest city in the largest state of the largest country of a given continent we'll need all the three functions. As before, you have an intuition behind how to do that. May be it's something like below.\n\nGet a Continent from somewhere.\nCall get_largest_country (level 1). Wait to retrieve the result because db ops could take long.\nCall get_largest_state for that country (level 2). Wait again.\nCall get_largest_city for that state (level 3). Wait again.\nReturn the city\n\nThe actual code is pretty short.\n\nauto get_largest_city_from_continent = [](Continent const &c) {\n  return get_largest_city(get_largest_state(get_largest_country(c).get()).get()).get();\n};\n\nThis implementation is fully synchronous and isn't optimized to use nice properties of boost::future (yet). It may remind you of function composition we saw in the previous post. However, the .get() calls in between completely mess things for us. We can't use simple function composition because it does not call .get().\n\nLet's rewrite operator >>= that would work with functions that return boost::future. We want to compare it with that of the Vector type.\n\ntemplate \nauto operator >>= (F&& f, G&& g)\n{\n  using FArg = arg_type_t;\n  using GResult = result_type_t;\n    \n  return [f,g] (FArg a) -> GResult {\n      return g(f(a).get());\n  };\n}\n\nJust like before, this function operates only two levels at a time because we pass only two functions to it. The implementation is much simpler than before because the argument functions return a boost::future and it may contain at most one value. We retrieve it using .get() and pass it on to function g. \n\nNeedless to say this implementation of >>= does not look much like the earlier (Vector) implementation of operator >>=. Is there anything common/reusable at all? Can we refactor these two functions into something reusable? Let's observe them closely under a special microscope--generic programming microscope.\n\nRefactoring To a Generic operator >>=\n\nDisclaimer: This section may appear a little too abstract and hand-wavy. As I already know how the refactoring is going to look like, I may skip ahead too fast and may be too hasty about some generalizations. Let me know what you think. Here we go.\n\nHere's what I see in the implementations of operator >>=\n\nBoth functions are higher-order. I.e. they take functions as arguments and return a new composite function.\nThe type of the composite function depends on the types of the arguments. Specifically, the composite function is "just like" the argument functions. \nIn both cases, the argument type of the composite function is the same as that of F and the return type is the same as that of G.\nFunction f and g accept an argument of a simple type and return a value "wrapped" in a generic container. The notable difference is of the container type (Vector and boost:future, respectively). Hmm, template template parameter? \nThere's a dependency between f and g. f is invoked before g. Always. That's generic. This is key.\nThe argument passed to the composite function is passed to f (i.e., f(a)). As the return value of f is a generic container, the contained value(s) are somehow extracted and passed to g. In the case of Vector we use a for loop and in the case of boost::future, we use .get(). The specific way to get to the guts of the container is dependent on the container type. The composite function "collapses" two nested levels into one. In the case of Vector, two nested loops. In the case of boost::future, two calls to the database appear as one from outside. These things are very very specific to the container. There's no hope to generalize it. This is key too and the most hand-wavy observation.\n\nWhat in the world all this means? And how we might express these observations in C++ in a reusable manner? Not all is reusable as we observed. Items #1 to #5 appear something like we can write reusable code for. #6 does not as the details depend on the container type---a template (as opposed to an instantiation of it).\n\nSounds like we need a template template parameter. Fine. But a template template parameter of what?\n\nThe Genius of Monad\n\nSo what we are looking for is known as a monad. That's the name it gets because mathematicians reached here first--long before we programmers existed. Let's just accept the name and move on.\n\nBased on the commonalities listed above, we need something with nearly the same capabilities except for #6. It should allow to plug an implementation that is dependent on the container type. We are in pursuit of a monad-aware implementation of operator >>=. As #1 through #5 are reusable pieces of code, let's just copy-paste them. \n\n\ntemplate \nauto operator >>= (F&& f, G&& g)\n{\n  using FArg = arg_type_t;\n  using GResult = result_type_t;\n\n  return [f,g] (FArg a) -> GResult {\n      return get_monad::bind(f(a), std::move(g));\n  };\n}\n\nHopefully, it does not look too unexpected. \n\nAs you can see, this implementation has the same shape but with more flexibility. It's higher-order. Returns a closure that accepts argument of the same type as F and returns the type as G. It invokes f(a). From this point on things look different. The pluggable "interface" we use is called bind. The result of f(a) is passed to bind which is dependent on type GResult. Further function g is also passed to bind because a generic implementation won't know how to peek into the value of f(a) and invoke g on it. That's the job of bind. So there must be specializations of bind for each container template. But first, we need to identify the container template. We use a template template parameter. \n\nHere's how get_monad looks like.\n\n\ntemplate \nstruct get_monad;\n\ntemplate \nstruct get_monad : monad {};\n\nIt is a simple wrapper over the real deal: monad. The job of get_monad is to pattern-match on GResult and extract the template-name and template arguments out. It simply forwards the template-name to the monad template. I.e., In case of get_monad, monad is instantiated with just Vector as in monad. Similarly, for the function returning boost::future, monad is instantiated.   \n\nThat brings us to the monad template, which accepts a template template parameter. \n\ntemplate\nstruct monad \n{ \n    template \n    static auto bind(M& m, Func&& func) -> result_type_t;\n};\n\nThis definition only serves as an "interface" and does no work. It's completely optional. Note the signature of bind though. It accepts an argument of type M, whatever M is. We'll look at two examples shortly. It also accepts a function, which must also return M. Bind calls one embellished function at a time. At this point, what we really need are the specializations of this template. Here's a monad specialization for Vector.\n\ntemplate\nstruct monad \n{    \n    template \n    static auto bind(const Vector& vec, Func&& func) -> result_type_t\n    { \n      // Alternatively,\n      // using Outer = decltype(func(std::declval()));\n      using Outer = result_type_t;\n      Outer outer;\n      for(const T& o: vec) {\n        const Outer& inner = func(o);\n        outer.insert(outer.end(), inner.begin(), inner.end());\n      }\n      return outer;\n    }\n};\n\nThe bind function accepts a Vector object and a function as arguments. The job of bind is to unwrap the Vector, get the values, and pass them to the function. That's just half the story. The function itself returns a Vector for every call. bind can return only one Vector. Therefore, bind needs to combine/flatten all the Vectors into one. The outer Vector is that flat Vector, which contains all the elements from the individual Vectors received from func. Note that if if the input vector is empty, the resulting vector is also empty. Likewise, if the function func returns empty Vectors every-time, the resulting Vector is also empty. This behavior is exactly same as commonly discussed list monad. \n   \nAnd here's a possible implementation using boost::future.\n\ntemplate\nstruct monad\n{\n    template \n    static auto bind(boost::future fut, Func&& func) -> result_type_t { \n      return func(fut.get()); \n    }\n};\n\nLike the Vector version, future version also accepts an object of future type (i.e., the container type) and a function. The bind function extracts the value out from the future by calling get. Only bind would know how to do that. It passes it on to the function. The function itself returns a future. We simply return it. This version is fully synchronous and wait for the result of the first function to arrive before calling the next function. Recall that fut is the result of calling f(a) in operator >>=. \n\nThe bind function is not unique and it may be implemented in multiple ways. A better alternative with boost::future is to chain the result one future to a subsequent function. In fact, that's what we've been doing all along. boost::future provides a nice api called .then to chain embellished functions that return futures. Therefore, an alternative implementation of monad::bind could be as follows.\n\n#define BOOST_THREAD_PROVIDES_FUTURE_CONTINUATION\n#define BOOST_THREAD_PROVIDES_FUTURE_UNWRAP\n#define BOOST_THREAD_PROVIDES_FUTURE\n#include \n\ntemplate\nstruct monad\n{\n    template \n    static auto bind(boost::future fut, Func&& func) -> result_type_t { \n        return fut.then([func](boost::future f) mutable { \n            return func(f.get()); // calling .get here does not block.\n        }).unwrap();\n    }\n};\n\nThe boost::future::then function is very similar to bind. The main difference is that the argument lambda to .then accepts a boost::future object as opposed the value in it. This complication is to support the possibility of futures that complete with an exception. If the first method (f) returns a future that resolves into an error, we may need to know about it. If a future resolves to an error, .get() rethrows the exception skipping all the subsequent chained functions. That's exactly what we want. \n\nThere's one more wrinkle that isn't clear in the code. .then wraps the return type of the lambda in a future. In our case the lambda returns a future itself. (e.g., future). Therefore, the resulting type of .then is future. That does not match with that of bind, which is just future. There're two ways out provided by boost::future. Either you can call .unwrap on future or rely on the unwrapping constructor of boost::future that auto converts future to future. I opted for the former for clarity.\n\nPutting It All Together\n\nWith this refactoring in place, our composeM function that does a left fold of embellished functions works just fine.\n\nvoid test()\n{\n  auto get_cities_from_continent = composeM(get_countries, get_states, get_cities);\n  auto get_largest_city_from_continent = composeM(get_largest_country, get_largest_state, get_largest_city);\n\n  Continent c;\n  auto cities = get_cities_from_continent(c);\n  auto largest_city = get_largest_city_from_continent(c).get();\n\n  std::cout < cities < "\\n" < largest_city < "\\n";\n}\n\nThat's pretty neat. The type of the container does not matter. We successfully abstracted the details of the container type in to it's respective bind functions. For new generic containers, all we need to do is to implement a specialization of bind. Bind is the function that allows us to compose (a.k.a. chain) a set of embellished functions belonging to the same container type (monad). As long as an implementation of bind satisfying the signature exists for a container, we can use it in fold expressions. Clearly, C++ fold expressions are quite versatile. As an exercise, try implementing bind for std::optional. It's fun!  Find out what monad that is. \n\nSomething's Amiss?\n\nIf you are familiar with the concept of a monad from Haskell or other languages, you know already that the monad abstraction presented above is not complete. It's missing a function called return (Haskell lingo), that accepts a unwrapped value and puts it into the chosen generic container (monad). Obviously, it is highly specific to the container used. Putting a value in a future differs significantly from putting a value in a Vector. \n\nI'm unsure if we really need a function like return because we just have constructors in C++ to do the job. For the sake of completeness, however, I will include it. \n\ntemplate< struct monad=> for right fish and \nThat's it! If you are still here, thank you for reading. Here's live code if you take it for a spin. This concludes the three part series on C++17 Fold Expressions.

Different roles beget different perspectives on software development, and so many perspectives over so much time have led Scott to strong views about the things that really matter. In this presentation, he’ll share what he believes is especially important in software and software development, and he’ll try to convince you to embrace the same ideas he does.\nBecause this isn't a C++ talk, I sent the DConf organizers a more general bio than I usually use. It may include some things about me you don't know, so perhaps you'll find it interesting:\n\nScott Meyers started programming in 1971, and he started teaching programming in 1972. He’s best known for his Effective C++ books, but he’s also worked on constraint expression for programming languages, program representations in development environments, software simulations of bacteriophage lambda, general principles for improving software quality, and the effective presentation of technical information. In 2009, he received the Dr. Dobb’s Excellence in Programming Award, and in 2014, an online poll likened his hair style to that of the cartoon character, He-Man.\nIf you're working with or interested in D, I encourage you to consider attending the conference. If so, be sure to stop by and say hello after my talk!\n\nScott\n\n\n	The View From Aristeia	http://scottmeyers.blogspot.co.il/2017/03/keynote-at-dconf-in-berlin-on-may-5.html	Article	3

What's going on? Is it a copy/paste error?It's what you do with it that countsLet's review the descriptions I gave in part 1:class error_code - represents a specific error value returned by an operation (such as a system call).class error_condition - something that you want to test for and, potentially, react to in your code.The classes are distinct types because they're intended for different uses. As an example, consider a hypothetical function called create_directory():void create_directory(    const std::string& pathname,    std::error_code& ec);which you call like this:std::error_code ec;create_directory("/some/path", ec);The operation can fail for a variety of reasons, such as:Insufficient permission.The directory already exists.The path is too long.The parent path doesn't exist.Whatever the reason for failure, after create_directory() returns, the error_code object ec will contain the OS-specific error code. On the other hand, if the call was successful then ec contains a zero value. This follows the tradition (used by errno and GetLastError()) of having 0 indicate success and non-zero indicate failure.If you're only interested in whether the operation succeeded or failed, you can use the fact that error_code is convertible-to-bool:std::error_code ec;create_directory("/some/path", ec);if (!ec){  // Success.}else{  // Failure.}However, let's say you're interested in checking for the "directory already exists" error. If that's the error then our hypothetical caller can continue running. Let's have a crack at it:std::error_code ec;create_directory("/some/path", ec);if (ec.value() == EEXIST) // No!  ...This code is wrong. You might get away with it on POSIX platforms, but don't forget that ec will contain the OS-specific error. On Windows, the error is likely to be ERROR_ALREADY_EXISTS. (Worse, the code doesn't check the error code's category, but we'll cover that later.)Rule of thumb: If you're calling error_code::value() then you're doing it wrong.So here you have an OS-specific error code (EEXIST or ERROR_ALREADY_EXISTS) that you want to check against an error condition ("directory already exists"). Yep, that's right, you need an error_condition.Comparing error_codes and error_conditionsHere is what happens when you compare error_code and error_condition objects (i.e. when you use operator== or operator!=):error_code against error_code - checks for exact match.error_condition against error_condition - checks for exact match.error_code against error_condition - checks for equivalence.I hope that it's now obvious that you should be comparing your OS-specific error code ec against an error_condition object that represents "directory already exists". C++0x provides one for exactly that: std::errc::file_exists. This means you should write:std::error_code ec;create_directory("/some/path", ec);if (ec == std::errc::file_exists)  ...This works because the library implementor has defined the equivalence between the error codes EEXIST or ERROR_ALREADY_EXISTS and the error condition std::errc::file_exists. In a future instalment I'll show how you can add your own error codes and conditions with the appropriate equivalence definitions.(Note that, to be precise, std::errc::file_exists is an enumerator of enum class errc. For now you should think of the std::errc::* enumerators as placeholders for error_condition constants. In a later part I'll explain how that works.)How to know what conditions you can test forSome of the new library functions in C++0x have "Error conditions" clauses. These clauses list the error_condition constants and the conditions under which equivalent error codes will be generated.A bit of historyThe original error_code class was proposed for TR2 as a helper component for the filesystem and networking libraries. In that design, an error_code constant is implemented so that it matches the OS-specific error, where possible. When a match is not possible, or where there are multiple matches, the library implementation translates from the OS-specific error to the standard error_code, after performing the underlying operation.In email-based design discussions I learnt the value of preserving the original error code. Subsequently, a generic_error class was prototyped but did not satisfy. A satisfactory solution was found in renaming generic_error to error_condition. In my experience, naming is one of the Hardest Problems in Computer Science, and a good name will get you most of the way there.Next up, a look at the mechanism that makes enum class errc work as error_condition placeholders.\n\n	Thinking Asynchronously in C++	http://blog.think-async.com/2010/04/system-error-support-in-c0x-part-2.html	Article	3

40	2013-06-28 10:29:00	The C++ Network Library 0.10.0 is Released	Finally, a new release for the cpp-netlib project has been published -- and we're making a few changes to the project in the process! To get the packages, please head on to the official project website:http://cpp-netlib.org/This 0.10.0 release is an incremental release on top of 0.9.4 which brings a couple of important changes. The first one is a change in how options are set when constructing the server and client objects, shedding the dependency on Boost.Parameter. The other change is better handling of chunked transfer encoding on the client side.There are a number of bugs that had been fixed so if you encountered some issues with 0.9.4, you might want to give 0.10.0 a shot.The reason we upped the minor version number is because of an interface change. We're using a different pattern for setting options which is a little more extensible and less magical than how Boost.Parameter works. To find out what's changed, please see the online documentation for the project:http://cpp-netlib.org/0.10.0/index.htmlWith this release the project will now follow a three-month release cycle. Any changes on top of 0.10.0 will be released at the end of September, 2013. As with the release of 0.9.4, we will be supporting the 0.10.x line for two years.Another change is that the project will be moving forward to push changes to release a 1.0 version by the end of 2013. That release will be fully reliant on C++11 features and will minimize dependency on Boost -- preferring standard libraries where they make most sense.If you'd like to be part of the effort please join us on the mailing list. As always development happens at the official repository using a GitHub workflow.Feedback, bug reports, and as with most open source projects, contributions are most welcome!\r\n             \r\n	Cpp Soup	http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/CppSoup/~3/advpRZS3Vsc/the-c-network-library-0100-is-released.html	Article	3
49	2012-09-25 16:00:00	cpp-netlib: HTTP API Plan Updates; Part I - History	With Glyn's work on the URI proposal the C++ Network Library project has been moving forward onto bigger goals. One of these goals is the overhaul and update of the library to use more C++11 features and to update the HTTP client and server implementations based on past implementation and user experience. A lot of the feature requests and issues encountered with the older API are being addressed by the API overhaul. This post is about what direction the library is taking with background information on the recently published HTTP Client/Server API Design Doc (link). This is Part 1 of a 3-part series on the history, current issues, and future direction of the cpp-netlib project.First, a little bit of history on how the C++ Network Library came to being. This is important to frame the following discussion on what's happened since then and what will be happening going forward.I was working on a project that required making HTTP client requests to a third-party service from a client application in 2007. Up to that point I had mostly been working on HTTP on the server side -- implementing servers was something I was used to doing and I much enjoyed. However though I found myself unimpressed with any of the interfaces of HTTP clients that I cared to look at -- at the time there were mostly C libraries (CURL is a popular one) that did it and on Microsoft Windows there were the .NET managed C++ bindings for the HTTP implementation (can't remember if it's in the ATL).I thought to myself: this couldn't be right, there should really be a simple HTTP client implementation in C++ out there. At the time Boost.Asio was only getting into Boost (1.34 was out then, but I was already using Boost.Trunk because of Boost.Asio) and the example HTTP client implementation seemed simple enough to use. However I ran into issues with Windows having wchar_t as default so I can't easily just stream bytes to the server, because HTTP is an ASCII/UTF-8 protocol.This gave me a choice: either I use the managed C++ bindings and the Microsoft ATL or start an open source project that implemented an HTTP client using Boost.Asio. As any self-respecting open source enthusiast with an extremely positive attitude and an itch to scratch would do, I chose to start an open source project to tackle that problem. I first set out to get Boost developers involved in the effort too with the hopes that I would be able to spend 6 months worth of unpaid work time to hack something up quickly and get it reviewed and maybe accepted into Boost.My experience with implementing an HTTP server in C++ got positive results in doing a lot of things with template metaprogramming and little to no dynamic polymorphism. This gave me an idea to do the client implementation the same. I am personally very comfortable with template metaprogramming and had been very successful with it on the server side that I thought it would translate well into the client side.Boy was that a mistake -- not the starting the project part, but in the under-estimating the amount of work that goes into an HTTP implementation using template metaprogramming techniques for extensibility. What I came up with initially worked well, was efficient enough, but was single-threaded and didn't use resources effectively (all the data is in std::string's and I still couldn't support std::wstring's). The early releases of the project worked its way to a point where the string type was a template parameter and that the only implementation that was actually tested was the std::string -- literals were just bare "const char*" instead of being something wrapped in a macro.Initial feedback on the library's client interface has been positive. It's really simple to use and you approach the HTTP client like it was an object that did all the HTTP work for you -- you pass in a request, you get a response. Easy, simple, intuitive.Then requests came in to get an HTTP server implemented. People liked the client implementation and some had asked whether we can get a server into the library as well because that's where C++ would really make sense. Not a lot of people wanted to write C++ code that actually made calls to HTTP resources, as there are a lot of other dynamic languages that would make this task really easy (besides there's already a lot of client libraries out there, so this is a very big mountain to climb). I hesitated first to implement an HTTP server because even though I had done this while I was at Friendster, that implementation remained proprietary despite my pleas to make that implementation open-source.When I left Friendster in 2009 though I found myself able -- and wanting -- to implement an HTTP server template that would be simpler to use and was more generic. Unfortunately I couldn't bring the techniques I used while I was in Friendster because the build times for the server were actually pretty awful -- a full build took me, with -O3 optimizations, using GCC 3.4 at the time 20 minutes on multiple concurrent threads on a quad-core 2007-class Opteron. The resulting binary was tight and the bottleneck had become the memory-cache transfers (computations were mostly memory I/O bound, not CPU bound) but you can't ask everyone using the implementation to wait 20 minutes before they can start using the resulting binary.I hacked up a quick server side implementation and got it mostly working and put it into the project. There were lots of requests for features but I had found myself involved with other endeavors (and real life -- I got married and became a father in 2009 and had started on a new role with greater responsibilities as well). The server implementation had been useful to some people already and is one of the popular topics on the mailing list right after the release where it was included.Then another mistake was thiking that the tag-based trait system -- which is still the most flexible&nbsp;way of designing static type-families (I should really write a paper about this technique independent on cpp-netlib) -- would scale well. By the time BoostCon 2010 came up, I had an HTTP client and server implementation that only had one template parameter: a tag. All the traits required to make decisions in the HTTP client's and server's implementation was hinged on this single type -- there were a dozen trait metafunctions that determined what strategy to use for resolving domain names, what type of string to use, whether the implementation was fully async, etc. I also provided a way of creating tags by composing multiple "foundational" tags.This approach proved effective -- if you think about Haskell's type classes, the tag would have been a type constructor where you had functions defined in the form of trait metafunctions.That was the good part -- the bad part is that building anything that used the client or the server implementation meant 15 minutes of CPU time and &gt;2GB of RAM compiling the object file. Some users had complained that MSVC 2009 couldn't handle it in 32-bit mode. That clearly wasn't going to work.I trudged along though and still maintained that implementation. The problem came then when I wanted to allow streaming support to the client API. All the template metaprogramming that made things efficient and effective also made it really hard to read, even for me. I would spend hours building the mental model of what I wanted to achieve and trying to rationalize the solution and fit it into the ever growing tangled mess of templates and intermediary types. One day a typo I introduced that turned a reference into a bare copy parameter caused a spew longer than 2000 lines -- and I didn't want to touch my own implementation for a couple of weeks.I became disgusted with the implementation and I found that the only way forward was to abandon the header-only approach and remove most of the template metaprogramming. This allowed me to take a good look at the API and cut down a lot of the mental gymnastics just to implement a feature.&nbsp;I still love the power that template metaprogramming affords me when I need it. Unfortunately though I cannot tell anybody with a straight face that template metaprogramming is something I still love doing.With this realization, more recent work became moving most of the implementation from being reliant on template metaprogramming to leveraging more traditional library design. I embraced the notion that I can model things better using OOP and implement the generic parts as templates. The current stable release (0.9.4) already defaults to a non-header-only approach which cuts down the build times for users significantly and makes it easier to integrate the library in more traditional applications where development cycles rely on quick builds.In the next part of this series I write about what the current state of affairs is, what the issues we're currently encountering in supporting new features and addressing deficiencies in the implementation are, and see why these issues exist. The final part of the series will delve into greater detail on what the reasoning is for the API refresh and what the plan of attack is for further work on the library.\r\n             \r\n	Cpp Soup	http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/CppSoup/~3/cwqgcbOX2GU/cpp-netlib-http-api-plan-updates-part-i.html	Article	3
57	2011-10-31 12:18:00	New C++ Standard, New Focus	Now that the new version of C++, C++11 is out in the wild as an ISO C++ Standard, there's a renewed focus on getting applications, tools, and books up to date with the new standard. The leaders of the ISO Committee have weighed in on the latest versions of the language. There's Herb Sutter writing about C++11, there's Bjarne Stroustrup's C++11 FAQ, and the upcoming C++Now! conference that's going to be held in Aspen Colorado. Clang is racing to get C++11 support into the stable release of the compiler, and GCC is humming along nicely with it as is Microsoft's Visual C++. Instead of write about any specific things, I would lend my opinion on what needs to be the new focus not for C++11 the language, but the supporting toolchains surrounding this new language -- and the version that's coming after this one.Having been exposed to a number of programming languages and paradigms I'd like to think that I've seen quite a bit of the programming world. There's the dynamic programming languages like Python, Ruby, Lua, JavaScript, and its ilk, and there's the relatively new static languages like Go, Scala, Haskell, Erlang, among others. Systems programming and application programming have new challenges -- concurrency, consistency, safety, etc. -- that need attention from both the programming language and the libraries that come with the programming environment. There are new platforms that are designed to perform more and more demanding computations in very meager amounts of available resources. The web is ever-growing and there's a lot more things web applications need to do both at the front and back-end of the system. And there are yet a lot more applications to be thought in embedded and large-scale systems that current programming languages have yet to even think about (autonomous computing anyone?).With these in mind, I think C++ has to evolve into a direction that makes simple things easy and hard things possible. There was a time that C++ was the language of choice because much of the infrastructure that's available now was not available then -- you kinda had to write your own tools back in the day, and C++ was the easier programming language to use for large systems. Unfortunately now, even with the new features that makes it easier to write programs in C++ using the new modern style, a big percentage of the programs still turn out to be either glue code or repetitive boilerplate. If you're writing asynchronous systems, they're made easy with lambda's, efficient containers, consistent memory model, and concurrency primitives (or at least standard libraries) but you end up with a lot of boilerplate because there aren't any sane standard HTTP implementations -- interfacing with C libraries will be a lot more painful with C++11 considering how much of the C++ standard defines things outside of the C standard's scope. C++11 is awesome if you're starting from scratch but when you get to the part where you have to tie libraries together, C++ is still an expert's language.I'm hinting at two things here that C++ should address in my opinion going forward: a standardized way of defining modules for easier composition and higher level standard libraries with reference implementations. Let's tackle each in order here.First, standardized modules. The reason programming languages like Go, Haskell, and Erlang are getting traction for back-end programming (in the case of Erlang, it's not really a "systems programming" language unlike Go and Haskell) is because it has a simple and standardized module mechanism. Packaging code in modules that can be programmed against (ala Pascal Units) in terms of interfaces makes modular development really easy. Right now all the module implementations in C++ are vestiges to how the linkers are implemented and implementation specific. There's a lot of details here that's worth fleshing out at a later time (there's a lot of content for the blog) but needless to say it should be simple to import modules into a compilation unit for later linkage -- and this should be made standard across implementations.One of the problems that standardized modules will solve is that of the definition and implementation of the standard library. The STL is awesome as it is at the moment, but it can be a lot more awesome if there's a defined module layout that will be the same across all platforms and that people can implement shrink-wrapped modules that play well with many other modules in a non-conflicting manner. C++ already has namespaces and it's a mechanical manner of tying namespaces to modules. Extending a module should then be a matter of dependency and linkage. Without going much into details, C++ needs to solve the problem of coupling. Many things need to be thought out, like how the runtime environment deals with types and namespaces and how linkage and application binary interfaces can be made consistent without sacrificing performance.The second thing that does need attention is that runtime environment. I'm not just talking about garbage collection and I'm not talking about having a virtual machine. What I'm talking about is the management of runtime elements, things like memory, I/O, concurrency, among other things. Although it is not impossible to write OS kernels in C++, the C++ runtime is mostly still the C runtime (i.e. too limited) to make things like a global optimizing allocation mechanism, thread scheduling, implementing co-routines, and magical things that makes systems programming interesting very painful to do. A standardized runtime environment can make writing stand-alone systems in C++ easier and less reliant on the C runtime. This can also finally solve things like module initialization (when dynamically loading things), static initialization, memory management, and even reflection and runtime introspection features that can be implemented in a standard manner.The runtime should be as programmable as the Lisp environments, as minimalistic as the Lua runtime, and as performance-sensitive as the C runtime. It should also be as open-ended as possible, still allowing for implementation-specific extensions but defining a standard core that others can build upon. There are a lot of things to flesh out in this idea but it's something that needs to happen to make C++ a language that's as viable for systems programming as well as application development with all the goodness of the dynamic languages and the safety of static languages. Short of defining a virtual machine, a standard runtime implementation should definitely be considered for the next version of C++. I don't like virtual machines as much as the next person but having a well-defined runtime environment will make systems programming a lot less hack-laden as it currently is.With these in mind I'm putting some effort into writing up papers to that effect so that hopefully these ideas get at least thought about in the next ISO C++ Standards Committee meeting in Kona Hawaii. Hopefully I can get comments and ideas and a discussion going with esteemed colleagues and users from around the world who might have an interest in joining an effort to make this a reality. Let's make C++ even better by bringing good ideas from other programming languages into C++ without sacrificing the performance and flexibility afforded by our favorite programming language.Along with this effort I'm going to work on getting the C++ Network Library reviewed for inclusion into Boost and hopefully be a reference implementation for a high-level network library to be made part of the C++ standard. I think it's about time that C++ gets modern programming features and Web-aware libraries part of the standard to make it more attractive to developers who might want to develop high performance solutions in C++ for the Internet. I'll be supporting the standardization of the Asynchronous I/O library that's already part of Boost so that it can be the standard way of programming asynchronous I/O in C++ and made available to more people who do use C++ for network programming.It's an exciting time ahead for C++ and I fully intend to help influence that future too.\r\n             \r\n	Cpp Soup	http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/CppSoup/~3/D-nzNzaMtTw/new-c-standard-new-focus.html	Article	3
66	2016-12-27 00:00:00	Folding Functions	\n\nIn the last post we looked at basic usage of C++17 Fold Expressions. I found that many posts on this topic discuss simple types and ignore how folds may be applicable to more complex types as well. [Edit: Please see the comments section for some examples elsewhere in the blogosphere.] In this post I'm going to describe folding over functions.\nComposing Functions\n\nFunction composition is a powerful way of creating complex functions from simple ones. Functions that accept a single argument and return a value are easily composable. Consider the following example to compose two std::functions.\n\n\ntemplate \nstd::function compose(std::function f, std::function g)\n{\n  return [=](A a) -> C { return g(f(a)); };\n}\n\nint main(void)\n{\n    std::function to_num = [](std::string s) { return atoi(s.c_str()); };\n    std::function is_even = [](int i) { return i%2==0; };\n    auto is_str_even_num = compose(to_num, is_even);\n    std::cout < std::boolalpha < is_str_even_num("1234"); // prints true\n}\n\n\nFunction compose accepts two std::function arguments and returns another one. The types of these std::function arguments are important. f is a function from A->B where as g is a function from B->C. Therefore, it makes sense that compose can generate another function of type A->C. The output f goes to the input of g. The implementation of the lambda confirms that.\n\nAs std::function is kind of verbose and not very idiomatic in C++ when you want to pass functions around. I'll try to use C++11 lambdas initially. I want to stay away from generic lambdas because argument and return types are kinda important. In generic lambdas, however, it's impossible to find their argument and return types without knowing an actual argument or its type. Note that in compose function we have access to functions only and no arguments.\n\nLets rewrite compose to accepts lambdas.\n\n\ntemplate >.  \n\ntemplate \nauto operator >>(F&& f, G&& g)\n{\n  return [f,g](auto a) { return g(f(a)); };\n}\n\nWith this final variation, functions can be folded over in a binary fold expression.\n\nI will conclude this blog post with a bit of monoid theory. \n\nYou might wanna ask yourself if function composition is another monoid? As it turns out, it is. It makes sense intuitively. Composition of two functions give rise to another function. The composition is also associative. It does not matter if we call compose(f, compose(g,h)) or compose(compose(f,g),h). The end result is the same. Squint a little and you will realize that they are just left and right folds. Finally, there's also an identity function, which when combined with any other function makes no observable difference. Therefore, we can say that function form a monoid under composition. \n\nNext time we'll look at even more interesting functions---those return values wrapped a generic "container". \n\n\n	C++ truths	http://cpptruths.blogspot.co.il/2016/12/folding-functions.html	Article	3

96	2015-11-17 00:00:00	The Brick Wall of C++ Source Code Transformation	\n\nIn 1992, I was responsible for organizing the Advanced Topics Workshop that accompanied the USENIX C++ Technical Conference. The call for workshop participation said: \n\nThe focus of this year's workshop will be support for C++ software development tools.  Many people are beginning to experiment with the idea of having such tools work off a data structure that represents parsed C++, leaving the parsing task to a single specialized tool that generates the data structure. \nAs the workshop approached, I envisioned great progress in source code analysis and transformation tools for C++. Better lints, deep architectural analysis tools, automatic code improvement utilities--all these things would soon be reality! I was very excited.\n\n\n\nBy the end of the day, my mood was different. Regardless of how we approached the problem of automated code comprehension, we ran into the same problem: the preprocessor. For tools to understand the semantics of source code, they had to examine the code after preprocessing, but to produce acceptable transformed source code, they had to modify what programmers work on: files with macros unexpanded and preprocessor directives intact. That means tools had to map from preprocessed source files back to unpreprocessed source files. That's challenging even at first glance, but when you look closer, the problem gets harder. I found out that some systems #include a header file, modify preprocessor symbols it uses, then #include the header again--possibly multiple times. Imagine back-mapping from preprocessed source files to unpreprocessed source files in such systems!\n\nDealing with real C++ source code means dealing with real uses of the preprocessor, and at that workshop nearly a quarter century ago, I learned that real uses of the preprocessor doomed most tools before they got off the drawing board. It was a sobering experience.\n\nIn the ensuing 23 years, little has changed. Tools that transform C++ source code still have to deal with the realities of the preprocessor, and that's still difficult. In my last blog post, I proposed that the C++ Standardization Committee take into account how source-to-source transformation tools could reduce the cost of migrating old code to new standards, thus permitting the Committee to be more aggressive about adopting breaking changes to the language. In this post, I simply want to acknowledge that preprocessor macros make the development of such tools harder than my last post implied.\n\nConsider this very simple C++:\n\n#define ZERO 0\n\nauto x = ZERO;\nint *p = ZERO;\n\nIn the initialization of x, ZERO means the int 0. In the initialization of p, ZERO means the null pointer. What should a source code transformation tool do with this code if its job is to replace all uses of 0 as the null pointer with nullptr? It can't change the definition of ZERO to nullptr, because that would change the semantics of the initialization of x. It could, I suppose, get rid of the macro ZERO and replace all uses with either the int 0 or nullptr, depending on context, but (1) that's really outside its purview (programmers should be the ones to determine if macros should be part of the source code, not tools whose job it is to nullptr-ify a code base), and (2) ZERO could be used inside other macros that are used inside other macros that are used inside other macros..., and especially in such cases, reducing the macro nesting could fill the transformed source code with redundancies and make it harder to maintain. (It'd be the moral equivalent of replacing all calls to inline functions with the bodies of those functions.)\n\nI don't recall a lot of talk about templates at the workshop in 1992. At that time, few people had experience with them. (The first compiler to support them, cfront 3.0, was released in 1991.) Nevertheless, templates can give rise to the same kinds of problems as the preprocessor:\n\ntemplate\nvoid setToZero(T& obj) { obj = 0; }\n\nint x;\nsetToZero(x);    // "0" in setToZero means the int\n\nint *p;\nsetToZero(p);    // "0" in setToZero means the null pointer\n\nI was curious about what clang-tidy did in these situations (one of its checks is modernize-use-nullptr), but I was unable to find a way to enable that check in the version of clang-tidy I downloaded (LLVM version 3.7.0svn-r234109). Not that it matters. The way that clang-tidy approaches the problem isn't the only way, and one of the reasons I propose a decade-long time frame to go from putting a language feature on a hit list to actually getting rid of it is that it's likely to take significant time to develop source-to-source translation tools that can handle production C++ code, macros and templates and all.\n\nThe fact that the problem is hard doesn't mean it's insurmountable. The existence of refactoring tools like Clang-tidy (far from the only example of such tools) demonstrates that industrial-strength C++ source transformation tools can be developed. It's nonetheless worth noting that such tools have to take the existence of templates and the preprocessor into account, and those are noteworthy complicating factors.\n\n-- UPDATE --\n\nA number of comments on this post include references to tools that chip away at the problems I describe here. I encourage you to pursue those references.

As you all have known for a while now I've been working at Google Australia for two years now and part of the work involves some really interesting C++ development. I can't talk much about the things I've been doing in Google, but I can talk about some learnings I've picked up along the way as far as large-scale C++ development is concerned. If you're not interested in "meta" or "personal reflection" discussions, you can safely skip this post and you wouldn't have missed much.OverviewIn the past three months I've been fortunate to get my hands dirty with working on evolving a widely used piece of C++ code from one form to another. This piece of code is a core library and the amount of code depending on it is non-trivial (in the order of hundreds of thousands of libraries/tests) and my task was relatively trivial: mark a member function from a class deprecated, migrate all users to two alternatives, and finally remove the member function from the said class. This post is about the things I've learned in the process that I can share with the outside world.ChallengesThere's a number of challenges that I've faced in this effort. Without going into specifics (and the how I've made the changes) there are more pertinent human issues that I've had to deal with.When you have thousands of engineers who have to learn to use your API, having a smaller surface area is generally better. Cutting down the API later on is going to be a problem -- it's much easier to add than to remove and if you can avoid supporting complex APIs then you should avoid it.Social issues are much harder to solve than technical issues. When people are already used to doing things a certain way, change is harder to effect. In general getting people to agree that a change is a good idea is usually harder than making the actual change.Teaching people is hard. Novices aren't as hard to teach as people who know enough to be dangerous -- I'm happy that teaching is one of my passions, and that I enjoy teaching. I like teaching and sharing makes the endeavour a little easier, but in general is still hard.Change should not be for change's sake. Having a goal, a plan, and a good rationale that's clearly explained and widely understood makes large scale changes easier. If the costs are worth paying for to get to an end state that is measurably (or qualitatively at least) better than the current state, communicate and make it clear.The larger theme for me in the past few months (and two years that has passed) is the realisation of how scale totally changes how you think about getting things done.ScaleWhen you're responsible for a result that spans more than just one project, the amount of impact you're able to make is both significant and insignificant at the same time. There's a funny thing about large numbers: in relation to the whole, a big number may be a lot -- but many little things also add up. If the change you're making is an effective "no-op" (or a change to keep things the same) then no matter how many changes you make the effect in aggregate is insignificant. In comparison if you're improving the performance of a specific function that gets used everywhere, even if your change is small the effect is big.Dealing with a large codebase (in the order of a hundred million lines of code) changes the scale conversation significantly. Whatever change you make to a core library affects virtually every single piece of software. Without thinking about the details -- build systems, applying the changes, running the tests, etc. -- what's important to note is how important being conservative is. The amount of planning involved in making sure that changes on core libraries being used will not result in wide breakages and performance regressions is non-trivial and should not be taken for granted. It's not a simple problem and the key to executing well is good planning as well as a healthy dose of patience.At this scale, language features and local style become very distracting. In a codebase that large what counts more than intellectual purity and idiomatic expression is consistency. At Google, the style guide and a small group of arbiters become the de facto sources to refer to when the question of style comes up. This is for good reason -- everybody has to be able to read, understand, and maintain the code you write and the style you use should be consistent with everyone else. Surprisingly, when you're tasked with reading thousands of call-sites and surrounding code context, having a consistent style saves you tons of time and effort. Anything that keeps you from having to think about "magic" or "details" is a net win for productivity at scale.I've heard arguments for and against the Google style guide (it is publicly available) and as someone who's had to read code that other people have written, I welcome having a style guide that is actually followed.Local OptimaHaving said all that, using scale as a single hammer to treat every style decision is not the best way going forward. Usually there's a tension between what's best for a specific situation -- in design and in implementation -- and what's best for the good of all. Outside of Google, I've encountered this discussion multiple times and it has always been a judgment call.Because judgment calls, exemptions, special concessions specifically do not scale they are frowned upon when you reach a certain size. This makes the alternatives more dominant thereby making the cost of allowing something that had previously been outlawed (or non-existent) compounded over time. In this case scale becomes a problem.What I have learned though is that when you get a bunch of really smart people having a conversation about merits and plans where everyone's interest is served, you get results. I'm proud to be associated with Google engineers who I believe are top notch in terms of skill and attitude, who can have a civil conversation about what the right thing to do is and how we can forge a way forward to progress. Being among smart people who are willing to listen and make a change for the better is one of the reasons I'm very thankful I work in Google.ProcessPart of the problem introduced by scale is process: too much of it and you grind productivity to a halt, too little of it and you have chaos leading to very little productivity. Either way is bad so finding the sweet spot becomes crucial and very important. I won't be sharing the process involved in making a change, but I will share the process of getting to the process. I would think it applies to many different engineering organisations where process forming is not a well-defined process.I've condensed my learnings into a few bullet points:Experiment. Do this with rigor though, not just "try something and see what sticks". Be smart about what you're going to try, how you're going to define what actually works, and how you're going to analyze the results of the experiment. Treat it like a research project where you have hypotheses and treatments and proper analysis of results.Iterate. Once you've found one or two processes that seem to work, make incremental changes to improve productivity. It's crucial that you get your goals straight and your iteration incremental. Making changes doesn't mean throwing the whole process-building process out. Get feedback, tweak things, remove steps, add steps where necessary.Measure. Every step of the way it's important that you're keeping track of metrics. Rely on data not on just qualitative observations. If you can make measurements based on actual actions and results then do that -- there's nothing better than being able to quantify your progress or efforts then making changes based on actual data.Optimise. Once you have measurements from some iterations and enough observations and results, then you go back and make changes that will further improve your productivity. It doesn't matter whether you get to the optimal state as long as you're getting a decent amount of productivity.If you're building processes any other way you may be missing out on some opportunities for order of magnitude improvements in productivity.C++So far all I've been saying has more to do about software engineering and not really much about C++. There's a few things I've noted and observed as I was reading and writing lots of code in the past two years. These are observations about C++ itself and in general, writing software with it at Google's scale. I won't be revealing anything official from Google, as these are my personal observations.Avoiding chaos is easy, avoiding the chaos of order is hard. When you have multiple thousands of developers writing and changing code that have complex dependencies and sufficiently complex designs there is a premium on avoiding chaos. This is where design up-front or at least thinking about the design of the system early pays off. What becomes trouble is the chaos of order that happens when you have multiple things going on at the same time and multiple available components to use. It's a good problem to have but still something very hard to manage -- C++ as a programming language requires more discipline than other languages where dependencies can typically be broken up into proper modules. There are well-known ways of managing this but not all the engineers know how to do this. I'm positive there are changes in C++ coming down the pike (modules) and already available (inline namespaces) for managing change and dependencies.Warts are features and workarounds are idioms. I understand that C++ has its warts and for whatever it's worth the more you know about them the more things you can do with them. The good thing about the workarounds are they can be taught as idioms -- and they seem to carry well to industrial practice. Teaching how to use C++ has given me a better appreciation of how important idioms and communicating the deficiencies are. I would argue this is a good thing about C++, that it's not burdened by elegance or by nice and shiny bells and whistles. What you get with using C++ is the raw performance that your tools can afford you and the scale of the systems you can build with it -- warts included.Experts scale better with C++. When you have experts in the language and the standard writing and maintaining the core libraries and the tools made available to everyone else, you get David standing on the shoulders of Goliath. You get the users of the libraries to a state of productivity leveraging what the experts build. Having the experts available one email away is also an invaluable resource to the organisation. Because the experts can keep banging out the amazing libraries and have others learn from the library designs you immediately raise the level of understanding of the language. I'm thankful that in Google we have C++ experts on tap from whom I have already learned a lot from.Pound per pound, C++ is the best programming language for systems programming. Especially when you're measuring things in the millisecond scale, every microsecond counts. There's yet to be another programming language that lets programmers control every aspect of the solution, enable the scalable design and implementation of sufficiently complex systems, and be as efficient as possible with resource usage. Being able to control exactly how many allocations you're going to make, avoid copies of data, exploit concurrency at the lowest possible level, and in general only pay for what you actually use is golden. It translates to effective resource utilisation, the avenues for optimisation are wider, and the return on effort more measurable.It is no secret that Google's success is built on great systems programming, amazing infrastructure, and brilliant engineers. It so happens that the company has made big bets on C++ and it has paid off a lot.ConclusionIn the end I've been learning a lot about large scale library and systems development. Making changes to something that's core to the system and being able to execute these changes has exposed me to very interesting learning opportunities. Being exposed to and working beside some amazing engineers has taught me a lot not just about how to technically get things done but also how to take the learning experience and build on it. Having a better insight into how large scale development works first hand is a very valuable experience -- something I'm very thankful for that I'm able to earn in Google.Here's to looking forward to more insights and more learnings from inside the GOOG.\r\n             \r\n	Cpp Soup	http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/CppSoup/~3/WW8gcylC_sU/hiatus-and-reflections.html	Article	3

Glyn Matthews (follow @glynos and on Google+) has been hard at work in getting the URI library implementation in cpp-netlib in good shape and he's written a proposal to get the URI library interface adopted in the next version of the standard. If you'd like to get the details of the proposal, you can get to it from his Github page. This post is about a little background as to why we're doing this and what we intend to achieve as a larger goal.It's not a secret that the C++ standard library is full of great things already, especially in C++11. However the committee believes that there's a lot of great ideas outside of the committee and that we'd like to get more useful libraries into the standard library. There's a call for proposals for the library working group and members of the committee are looking forward to hear the great ideas coming from the community on what should be included in the next standard.One of the areas which is sorely lacking especially in this day and age is a standard network programming library in C++. There are a number of foundational libraries (Boost.Asio is one, ACE is more a framework, while Berkeley Sockets are very low-level building blocks) which deserve mention and attention, but nothing yet has become a "de facto" standard. The committee recognizes that network programming is a crucial area for modern application development -- after all we are living in the age of cloud computing.One of the goals then is to get a coherent and comprehensive network programming library into the standard. Glyn and I have been working together for a while now on the C++ Network Library project since 2009 and we both have been doing this on a part-time best-effort basis. However we believe that our experience with implementing some of the hairy parts of HTTP (I still have a dream of getting other protocols included in the library) especially the URI implementation would be useful in getting a conversation started about how it should go.We've worked together with Niklas Gustafsson from Microsoft and Kyle Kloepper from Riverbed (head of the Networking Study Group) in forming this proposal. Niklas has also been in contact with people working on the Casablanca project -- which, by the way I'm very excited about as it's a validation of the clear need for a modern C++ library for network programming -- and has given great feedback on the early drafts of the paper. Glyn though did all of the heavy lifting of actually writing the proposal and now we've got a conversation starter for the Portland meeting.This idea of getting a network library into the standard is a big undertaking, one that will require lots of hard thinking and implementation experience to get right. The last thing we want to have is to put something into the standard that cannot be implemented in a sufficiently efficient and effective manner &nbsp;and has an interface that does not achieve its goals. On the other hand we'd really want to have a networking library as part of the standard to some extent, even if they're just foundational -- although it would be awesome if we can get at least an HTTP client in there.So for Portland, we have the URI implementation. If more people can help out in getting the implementation up to snuff for the next meetings as a reference implementation, that would be a good thing. Hopefully by this time next year the HTTP implementation of cpp-netlib will have also evolved to use C++11 fully, so that we can have HTTP servers and clients proposed for the standard library.This is an exciting time to be part of this project and I'm thoroughly thankful for Glyn's efforts in doing the work to get this proposal to the committee. Now we'd appreciate feedback and contributions in making the goals of cpp-netlib a reality, and hopefully all C++ programmers get to do network programming in a standardized manner across all platforms where C++ is supported.Stay tuned as we try to achieve more with cpp-netlib in the coming months and years.If you'd like to get involved in the project, please subscribe to the cpp-netlib mailing list&nbsp;and follow/fork the cpp-netlib project on Github. We'd love all sorts of contributions. The goal has slightly changed from being a project that's supposed to get into Boost, to one that's a self-sufficient and active project with a community built around it. What hasn't changed though is the development and maintenance of a production-quality modern open source C++ library for higher level network programming. Template metaprogramming experience no longer required to get involved either.\r\n             \r\n	Cpp Soup	http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/CppSoup/~3/HImPn0kfFQs/c-standard-proposals-standard-uri-type.html	Article	3
58	2011-08-25 14:25:00	Minus the Header-Only Dogma	I've been working on the C++ Network Library for a few years already total but have been on-and-off with it until recently. One of the first decisions that I made in implementing the library was to try and do a header-only approach to implementing a network library implementation. At first it made perfect sense -- you get the compiler to optimize as much of the code as it can while being able to expose a very friendly and expressive interface. When it was merely a handful of header files and there was just the notion of a message and the HTTP client, all was fine. I was perfectly happy showing off really simple but powerful use-cases where you'd want a C++ application to be able to make HTTP calls and get the contents without having any knowledge of how networks worked or how to program sockets on either Windows or UNIX-like systems. Until I got ambitious and it became a real project that people wanted to use -- then reality became real.It's not a secret that I like template metaprogramming. If you do a search on the site on 'metaprogramming' you'll find a number of posts dating back to around 2007 detailing the cool things that can be done with C++ templates. I've seen it first hand make really crazy performance improvements in production while I was still working at Friendster. Until recently the server I re-wrote with almost the whole network layer being a huge template metaprogram was humming along nicely. Unfortunately people didn't have the luxury of three things that I had at that time:\tThey don't have the same level of expertise with network programming. A vast majority of people who want to use cpp-netlib are people who don't want to implement the HTTP protocol from scratch or use a third-party library that was written in C. That said they didn't have the patience or experience necessarily to debug faults in cpp-netlib's implementation nor did they have the motivation to extend cpp-netlib.\tThey don't have time to wait for a simple HTTP client example to compile. It just took too much time to try to iterate with cpp-netlib since it was header-only and exercised the compilers too much for something that should be relatively simple.\tThey didn't buy into the header-only dogma. Much of the world was perfectly fine with linking to external libraries either dynamically or statically.After getting feedback from BoostCon 2010 about the cost of header-only libraries, I then thought long and hard about how to introduce externally linked libraries into cpp-netlib. What came after that was a process of thinking about how to actually get a header-only library to a point where it can support both a header-only build and a non-header-only build. I imagine there aren't a lot of people who would encounter this problem -- if it's even a problem at all -- but I wanted to point out a couple of things that I stumbled upon while "meditating" on this issue.Make it OptionalOne of the first things I had to do was to make the header-only version of the library optional. The rationale for this is pretty simple: compiling template metaprograms costs compiler time and effort in terms of debugging, so if you want to pay this cost you explicitly say it. This makes casual users happier by not having to pay the heavy cost of the compile time every time. This makes sense if you're in development mode and doing lots of builds often enough to not want to wait too long for each build to finish.In the C and C++ world, the way to make things optional at the source level is to make it a preprocessor macro. This is the first thing that made itself into the 0.9.0 release, the BOOST_NETWORK_NO_LIB macro which when defined makes cpp-netlib a header-only library. This made cpp-netlib a not-header-only-lib by default. This approach allows me (and other developers) to compile the heavy-compile-cost parts of the library into externally statically linked libs once and link them in at the end. The first things that went into the external lib were the Boost.Spirit based parsers. This had cut down the cost of compiling the tests dramatically -- as much as 60% reduction in compile-time.The approach has its merits because it makes users who want to use the library in header-only mode explicitly ask for it. One of the reasons people would want to do this is to enable further inlining that the compiler can do in header-only mode when building releases. During debug or development mode, linking an external library is just fine if you have a reasonably fast linker.Abstract AppropriatelyThe good thing about being able to move things out into compiled external libraries is that you can program against interfaces. This means abstract base types and later binding. This is completely opposite to the original idea of using static dispatch for most everything that I wanted to achieve when I set out to implement cpp-netlib. When I looked at it long and hard, I saw that trying to do everything through static dispatch isn't so scalable in a number of ways:\tExtensibility was static. This meant that if you wanted to add an extension or alternate implementation, you'd have to hook into the library's static dispatch mechanisms. This is not trivial and only the bravest template metaprogrammers will even hazard a try to extend the library through the template dispatch mechanisms.\tHorizontally scaling was much impossible. This means adding alternate implementations was severely limited by the static nature of the bindings. For example, I had an idea of being able to statically determine which implementation of a particular string processing routine would be called given a tag type. I can see now that doing things this way makes adding support for things like CString (from Microsoft), QtString (from Qt), Boehm's cord/rope, and countless other string types tragically harder than if I use the normal generic programming approach instead of using type tag dispatch.\tDebugging is a pain. Not only does it take long to compile things, it takes long for the compiler to see/say where things went wrong. This makes debugging the library implementation hopelessly dependent on my patience on a given day. There were times when I just literally had no patience for compiler errors that I just left the code alone for days without touching it.Now with the help of dynamic polymorphism I'm able to appropriately abstract some parts of the library that do need the runtime polymorphism -- things like abstracting a connection whether it's SSL or a normal TCP/IP connection, and maybe later on support other underlying protocols like SCTP, and maybe even UDP if there's a use case for HTTP over UDP. This also makes testing the library much easier than it originally was.Doing it this way also allows me and other implementors to leverage the best of both the static and the dynamic worlds in the same library. One of the ongoing refactoring efforts that I'm undertaking is the development of a mini HTTP REST Service framework which should come out early September. This would allow for developing a service in a traditional OOP fashion while having the efficiency of a header-only network implementation supporting the HTTP server implementation. The same technique allows us to expose a Boost.Parameter based API on the HTTP Client side and hiding much (if not all) of the internal client implementation in a Pimpl idiom -- so the client implementation can remain template-heavy internally and can be compiled once, and linked to many times.RevelationsI personally am relieved that I now don't feel like I need to fight and feel the pain of being lonely in a template metaprogramming world. Although there are lots of template metaprogrammers now thanks to the excellent books and Boost C++ Library mailing lists, there is still a lot to be done to get template metaprogramming in the mainstream. I now think that the better strategy for getting it out in the hands of more people is by using the techniques and leveraging its power not just as a power tool but also as an adjunct to more traditional object-oriented programming techniques. I am going to be the first to point out that having been exposed to both OOP and template metaprogramming along with functional programming and generic programming that the synergies between/among these paradigms in C++ is what makes it such a unique and powerful programming language.Hopefully those who are interested in joining and contributing to an open source library that explores the power and synergies of the different programming paradigms in C++ will join the C++ Network Library project. I now host a weekly Google+ Hangout every Wednesday 11am Sydney time (GMT +11) to discuss with developers and users of the library the direction of the project, what's going on, and how the project can proceed. I also regularly post updates to the C++ Network Library mailing list.For the next release the target is to simplify much of the internal implementations to make it easier to test and understand for new-comers to the project, and along with that define how others might be able to take on more work in the library ranging from: testing, reporting issues, issue triage, updating the website, implementing new protocols, among many of the community/administrative work that comes with an open source project. We're targeting September 2 as the release date for version 0.10 which should feature better compile times and much better testing.You can add me on Google+ -- introduce yourself and let me know if you're interested in getting notified/invited to the regular cpp-netlib hangout.\r\n             \r\n	Cpp Soup	http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/CppSoup/~3/vnwCu0RZY_o/minus-header-only-dogma.html	Article	3
67	2016-12-26 00:00:00	Understanding Fold Expressions	\n\nC++17 has an interesting new feature called fold expressions. Fold expressions offer a compact syntax to apply a binary operation to the elements of a parameter pack. Here’s an example.\n\n\ntemplate \nauto addall(Args... args) \n{\n  return (... + args);\n}\naddall(1,2,3,4,5); // returns 15.\n\n\nThis particular example is a unary left fold. It's equivalent to ((((1+2)+3)+4)+5). It reduces/folds the parameter pack of integers into a single integer by applying the binary operator successively. It's unary because it does not explicitly specify an init (a.k.a. identity) argument. So, let add it.\n\n\ntemplate \nauto addall(Args... args) \n{\n  return (0 + ... + args);\n}\naddall(1,2,3,4,5); // returns 15.\n\n \nThis version of addall is a binary left fold. The init argument is 0 and it's redundant (in this case). That's because this fold expression is equivalent to (((((0+1)+2)+3)+4)+5). Explicit identity elements will come in handy a little later---when we have empty parameter packs or if we use user-defined types in fold expressions. \n\nFold expressions can be defined over a number of operators. 32 to be precise. They are + - * / % ^ & | = < > < >> += -= *= /= %= ^= &= |= *. \n\nIn this post you will see an example of each and see how each one behaves. So here's the whole enchilada.\n\n\n#include \n#include \n\n#define UNARY_LEFT_FOLD(NAME, OP)   \\\ntemplate          \\\nauto NAME(Args&&... args) {         \\\n  return (...

86	2016-11-27 00:00:00	The Great Foreign Edition Book Giveaway	\n\nOne of the nicer author perks is seeing your books appear in translation. In my 2003 Advice to Prospective Book Authors, I wrote: \n\nFew things evoke quite the level of giddiness as seeing a copy of your book in a foreign script. I, for one, cherished my books in Chinese, and I continued to cherish them even after I found out that they were actually in Korean.\nMy publishers generally send me at least one copy of each translation they authorize. I often receive several copies, however, and over the years, I've amassed  more copies of my books in foreign languages than I have use for. Look!—these are the extra copies I currently have:\n\n\n\nInstead of letting these books gather more dust, I've decided to give them away. Want one? Just ask. I'll autograph it for you and throw it in the mail, and all I'll request in return is that you cover the cost of postage.\n\nI'll describe the details of how the giveaway works in a moment, but first let me show you the available inventory. Most books are in a language other than English, but what I'm technically giving away are foreign editions, so a few have the same text as the US book (i.e., they're in English). Such editions are generally printed on cheaper paper than their US counterparts, and like almost all the books I'm giving away, they use only one ink color, even if the US version uses multiple colors. \n\nHere's what I've got:\n\n\n\n\nThings to bear in mind:\n\nFor books with two ISBN lines, each line represents a distinct ISBN for the book. The upper one is the older ISBN-10. The lower one is the newer ISBN-13. (ISBN-10 vs ISBN-13 is the publishing equivalent of IPv4 vs. IPv6.) \nSometimes there are multiple versions of the same translation, e.g., there are two entries for German and for Japanese translations of Effective C++, Third Edition. In such cases, the only difference is typically the cover design. As far as I know, the substance of all translations of a particular book into a particular language is the same.\nIn the table, "Chinese" is ambiguous, because there are two versions of printed Chinese: traditional and simplified. To find out which Chinese is meant, use your favorite search engine to look up a book's ISBN. \nI've tried to list accurate languages for the books, but, not being able to read most of them, I may have made a mistake here and there. If so, I apologize, and I hope you'll bring the errors to my attention.\nThe first two editions of Effective C++ are either old or really old. Both are out of date. They might be suitable for a C++ museum, or maybe you could employ them as research material for that Scott Meyers biography you've been working on (ahem), but the programming advice in these editions is not to be trusted. I'll send them to you if you ask me to, but before you make a request, think carefully about why you're doing it. It shouldn't be to improve your C++.\n\n\nHow the giveaway works:\n\nIf you'd like a book, send me email letting me know what you want and the address to which I should send it. If you'd like more than one book, that's fine, just list the books in priority order. (I'll ignore book requests posted as comments to this blog, sorry.)\nI'll let the requests roll in for about two weeks (until about December 9), then I'll decide who gets what on whatever basis I want. My general plan is to assign higher priority to earlier requests and to issue everybody one book before issuing anybody more than one (i.e., to use a pseudo-FIFO pseudo-round-robin algorithm), but my plan might change. If your request includes an unusually good reason to satisfy it, I'll increase your priority. (An example of an unusually good reason would be that you'd like books to stock a library, thus making them available to many people.)\nAt some point (by December 16, I hope), I'll let you know whether I can satisfy your request. If I can, I'll put your book(s) in the mail, let you know how much the postage is, and request that you send me that much by Paypal. As it happens, I've gone down this road a couple of times in the past, and some of the promised payments never materialized. Nevertheless, my faith in the basic honesty of C++ software developers endures. I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't do anything to change that.\n\nSoooo...who wants a book that I can't read, that's out of date, or both?\n\nScott\n\n	The View From Aristeia	http://scottmeyers.blogspot.co.il/2016/11/the-great-foreign-edition-book-giveaway.html	Article	3

Some 80 articles, interviews, and academic papers. A slew of blog entries, and more posts to Usenet and StackOverflow than you can shake a stick at. A couple of contributions to the C++ vernacular. A poll equating my hair with that of a cartoon character.\n\nI think that's enough; we're good to go. So consider me gone. 25 years after publication of my first academic papers involving C++, I'm retiring from active involvement with the language.\n\nIt's a good time for it. My job is explaining C++ and how to use it, but the C++ explanation biz is bustling. The conference scene is richer and more accessible than ever before, user group meetings take place worldwide, the C++ blogosphere grows increasingly populous, technical videos cover everything from atomics to zero initialization, audio podcasts turn commute-time into learn-time, and livecoding makes it possible to approach C++ as a spectator sport. StackOverflow provides quick, detailed answers to programming questions, and the C++ Core Guidelines aim to codify best practices. My voice is dropping out, but a great chorus will continue.\n\nAnyway, I'm only mostly retiring from C++. I'll continue to address errata in my books, and I'll remain consulting editor for the Effective Software Development Series. I may even give one more talk. (A potential conference appearance has been in the works for a while. If it gets scheduled, I'll let you know.)\n\n"What's next?," you may wonder. I get that a lot. I've spent the last quarter century focusing almost exclusively on C++, and that's caused me to push a lot of other things to the sidelines. Those things now get a chance to get off the bench. 25 years of deferred activities begets a pretty long to-do list. The topmost entry? Stop trying to monitor everything in the world of C++ :-)\n\nScott\n\n\n\n	The View From Aristeia	http://scottmeyers.blogspot.co.il/2015/12/good-to-go.html	Article	3

115	2010-04-09 00:00:00	System error support in C++0x - part 3	\n[ part 1, part 2 ]Enumerators as class constantsAs we have seen, the  header defines enum class errc:enum class errc{  address_family_not_supported,  address_in_use,  ...  value_too_large,  wrong_protocol_type,};the enumerators of which are placeholders for error_condition constants:std::error_code ec;create_directory("/some/path", ec);if (ec == std::errc::file_exists)  ...Obviously, this is because there's an implicit conversion from errc to error_condition using a single-argument constructor. Simple. Right?It's not quite that simpleThere's a few reasons why there's a bit more to it than that:The enumerator provides an error value, but to construct an error_condition we need to know the category too. The  facility uses categories to support multiple error sources, and a category is an attribute of both error_code and error_condition.The facility should be user-extensible. That is, users (as well as future extensions to the standard library) need to be able to define their own placeholders.The facility should support placeholders for either error_code or error_condition. Although enum class errc provides placeholders for error_condition constants, other use cases may require constants of type error_code.Finally, it should allow explicit conversion from an enumerator to error_code or error_condition. Portable programs may need to create error codes that are derived from the std::errc::* enumerators.So, while it's true that the line:if (ec == std::errc::file_exists)implicitly converts from errc to error_condition, there are a few more steps involved.Step 1: determine whether the enum is an error code or conditionTwo type traits are used to register enum types with the  facility:template struct is_error_code_enum  : public false_type {};template struct is_error_condition_enum  : public false_type {};If a type is registered using is_error_code_enum then it may be implicitly converted to an error_code. Similarly, if a type is registered using is_error_condition_enum, it can be implicitly converted to error_condition. By default, types are registered for neither conversion (hence the use of false_type above), but enum class errc is registered as follows:template struct is_error_condition_enum  : true_type {};The implicit conversion is accomplished by conditionally enabled conversion constructors. This is probably implemented using SFINAE, but for simplicity you need only think of it as:class error_condition{  ...  // Only available if registered  // using is_error_condition_enum.  template   error_condition(ErrorConditionEnum e);  ...};class error_code{  ...  // Only available if registered  // using is_error_code_enum.  template   error_code(ErrorCodeEnum e);  ...};Therefore, when we write:if (ec == std::errc::file_exists)the compiler has to choose between these two overloads:bool operator==(    const error_code& a,    const error_code& b);bool operator==(    const error_code& a,    const error_condition& b);It chooses the latter because the error_condition conversion constructor is available, but the error_code one is not.Step 2: associate the value with an error categoryAn error_condition object contains two attributes: value and category. Now that we're in the constructor, these need to be initialised correctly.This is accomplished by having the constructor call the function make_error_condition(). To enable user-extensibility, this function is located using argument-dependent lookup. Of course, since errc is in namespace std, its make_error_condition() is found there too.The implementation of make_error_condition() is simply:error_condition make_error_condition(errc e){  return error_condition(      static_cast(e),      generic_category());}As you can see, this function uses the two-argument error_condition constructor to explicitly specify both the error value and category.If we were in the error_code conversion constructor (for an appropriately registered enum type), the function called would be make_error_code(). In other respects, the construction of error_code and error_condition is the same.Explicit conversion to error_code or error_conditionAlthough error_code is primarily intended for use with OS-specific errors, portable code may want to construct an error_code from an errc enumerator. For this reason, both make_error_code(errc) and make_error_condition(errc) are provided. Portable code can use these as follows:void do_foo(std::error_code& ec){#if defined(_WIN32)  // Windows implementation ...#elif defined(linux)  // Linux implementation ...#else  // do_foo not supported on this platform  ec = make_error_code(std::errc::not_supported);#endif}Some historyThe original  proposal defined error_code constants as objects:extern error_code address_family_not_supported;extern error_code address_in_use;...extern error_code value_too_large;extern error_code wrong_protocol_type;The LWG was concerned about the size overhead of so many global objects, and an alternative approach was requested. We researched the possibility of using constexpr, but that was ultimately found to be incompatible with some other aspects of the  facility. This left conversion from enum as the best available design.Next, I'll start showing how you can extend the facility to add your own error codes and conditions.\n\n	Thinking Asynchronously in C++	http://blog.think-async.com/2010/04/system-error-support-in-c0x-part-3.html	Article	3

149	2010-07-19 00:00:00	Blog End	\nWhen I started this blog, my short-term goal was to have a place to think out loud about the uncertainty I felt as an author of technical material in a publishing world that was on the brink of making the transition from black-ink-on-white-paper to whatever comes next. I can't say I'm now feeling a lot less uncertain, and in fact the pace of change in the publishing world has only accelerated, as electronic publication assumes increasing importance, but I no longer feel as angsty about it.  This counts as progress.\n\nMy longer-term goal was to engage in a dialogue with people interested in the production of fast software systems such that I could do a better job with the content of Fastware!.  Doing that, however, requires that I write up reasonable initial blog posts to spur discussion, and I've found that this is not something I enjoy.  To be honest, I view it as overhead.  Given a choice between doing background research to learn more about a topic (typically reading something, but possibly also viewing a technical presentation, listening to a technical podcast, or exchanging email with a technical expert) or writing up a blog entry to open discussion, I find myself almost invariably doing the research. One reason for this is that I feel obliged to have done some research before I post, anyway, and I typically find that once I'm done with the research, writing something up as a standalone blog entry is an enterprise that consumes more time than I'm willing to give it.  It's typically easier to write the result up in the form of a technical presentation, then give the presentation and get feedback that way.  This, for example, is what I did with my work on CPU caches. \n\nMy work on Fastware! will continue, but I don't expect to make any more blog entries about it here.  Instead, I'll fall back on my usual policy of not making an announcement about anything until whatever it is I have to announce is fairly well-baked.  If you're interested in announcements of those type, I suggest you follow my "Professional Announcments" blog.\n\nScott\n\n	The Fastware Project	http://fastwareproject.blogspot.co.il/2010/07/blog-end.html	Article	3

The project's new home is now at http://cpp-netlib.org/ (links to the old site should automatically redirect to this domain). We're looking at scaling the effort of the project and enforcing a few processes for consistency and for velocity. A few highlight to the website content:A style guide. We are now getting to the point where we have a lot of code and more people sending in pull requests. In this light we've started a very minimalist style guide. We will discuss and update this as soon as we have more data to make decisions.A development policy document. We've attempted to codify what we do and how we do it.A proposal process. If you're considering getting involved or helping get your library developed or included in cpp-netlib, there's now a process for that.We're also now ramping up our migration to use Google Test and getting ready to use Clang Format to use the Google style-guide formatting (just for the formatting) to make the code more consistent. I'm driving that process and getting the codebase into a more maintainable state. I've learned in these past few years that readable code makes my life easier, and contributors lives easier. Having said this we're not going to compromise on features of C++11 that we're going to use. I believe that now is the time to use C++11.Personally I'm also driving the HTTP server re-write and hoping others will be interested in pitching into that effort (as well as the HTTP client re-write). Glyn has been driving the standardisation of the URI library and we're generally pleased with the feedback we've been receiving. My dream in the long term is that cpp-netlib can play a similar role that Boost has played for getting libraries widely used and tested focused on the network programming domain.To that end I'm happy that Google has officially acknowledged this effort, and starting really soon most of the work I will be doing will be going through the Google fork of cpp-netlib.Thanks for reading and I hope to be able to share more news about cpp-netlib soon!Postscript: I will go back to the topic of value semantics and virtual tables without using the virtual keyword at a later date. I'm taking my time with that but I should definitely have something ready soon.

51	2012-09-19 12:00:00	Portland Meeting: Oct. 15-19, 2012	It's just a few weeks away and the ISO C++ Committee will be meeting again this time in Portland, Oregon. If you're interested in the agenda, you can find it from the official Post-Kona Mailing (N3373). Just like the previous meeting the committee will continue to discuss defect reports, new library proposals, and language extension proposals. This meeting should be interesting because some new and exciting things will be coming in through the pipeline. The papers haven't been finalized yet but judging from what I've been hearing it's going to be a filled with cool updates and new proposals taking a lot of user (and expert) comments into consideration.Unfortunately though I won't be able to make it to the meeting as I have a scheduling conflict with other events. That being said though I will be sending an update to the Rich Pointers (N3340) paper with updates and comments from the previous meeting. I'm just working out some final kinks -- if you're interested in seeing the progress you can head on over to the N3340 github project (the paper has been converted to LaTeX instead of a Google Doc).There are a couple other things that may be coming up which I will be discussing on the blog when the pre-Portland mailing gets finalized and published. If you're interested in this process, stay tuned!In the meantime if you're looking to get involved with the process, I can shed a little more light on how it works in this Google Tech Talk I gave earlier in the year. The upshot of this is to point out which libraries you think should be made part of the standard (or at least what libraries you'd like to see part of the standard) and let us (those who go to the meetings) know so that we can start working on the proposals. If you would like to get involved in the proposal writing process too then that would be awesome&nbsp;-- the committee always appreciates all the help it can get especially outside the meetings.I've taken the liberty to embed the video here so you don't have to watch it on YouTube.As always, feedback is very much appreciated.\r\n             \r\n	Cpp Soup	http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/CppSoup/~3/VxusBRXUk0s/portland-meeting-oct-15-19-2012.html	Article	3

68	2016-11-05 00:00:00	Dependently-typed Curried printf in C++	\n\nJust a few days ago I came across an intriguing blog-post about type-safe printf using dependent typing. The blog-post has since become inaccessible and therefore, I've copied an excerpt here. I want to thank Zesen Qian for publishing this blog-post.\n\n\n.... printf originated from the C programming language and has been a headache since then because a proper call of printf requires the number and types of arguments to match the format string; otherwise, it may visit a wild memory or a wrong register. In recent versions of GCC this issue is addressed by type checks hard coded into the compiler itself, which is ugly because the compiler should not be caring about the safety of applications of a specific function.... \n\n\nThe key issue here is that, considering the curried version, the type of the returned function of applying the format string to printf, actually depends on the value of that format string. That is to say, printf "%s" : String -> String, and printf "%d%s%d" : Int -> String -> Int -> String, and so on. This is where dependent type comes in: in dependently typed language, the type of returned values of functions can be dependent on value of the arguments; .... ---- Zesen Qian (ICFP'2106)\nI thought it might be possible to achieve the same effect in C++. \n.\n\n\nCurrying\n\nCurrying is the technique of transforming a function that takes multiple arguments in such a way that it can be called as a chain of functions, each with a single argument. I've talked about currying from very basics in a previous post. I'll jump straight to an example this time.\n\nint multiply(int i, int j) { return i*j; }\n\nauto curry = [](auto binary) {\n  return [=](int i) {\n    return [=](int j) { \n      return binary(i, j);\n    };\n  };\n};\n\nauto mul = curry(multiply);\nauto a = mul(10);\nauto b = a(20);\nstd:: cout < b < std::endl; // prints 200\n\n\nFunction multiple takes both arguments at the same time. Function mul, which is a curried version, takes one argument at a time. Intermediate results, such as a, are themselves functions that take one of the remaining arguments. When all arguments are available, the original function evaluates producing a result.\n\n\nCurrying printf--dependently\n\nCurrying printf poses an extra challenge because (1) printf accepts a variable number of arguments and (2) the order of the types of the arguments is not fixed (past the first argument). More accurately, the order of the types of the arguments is determined by the format string. The format string of printf is a value---usually, a literal string. We want to make the types of the rest of the arguments dependent on the value of the first argument. That's pretty intriguing, imo. In effect, we need a way to codify the format string literal into a type and that's where the dependent-typing comes into play.\n\n\nTo codify a string literal into a type, we are going to use the C++ language feature proposed in N3599. This proposal includes an example of dependently-typed printf that accepts all arguments at once. We're going to twist it a little bit to accept one argument at a time.\n\n\nThe magic lies in the operator "" that converts a string literal into a type. Here's the code without further ado. Both clang and gcc support this extension. Perhaps it will be in C++17 standard soon or it already is.\n\n\n#include 	C++ truths	http://cpptruths.blogspot.co.il/2016/11/dependently-typed-curried-printf.html	Article	3

43	2012-11-09 13:54:00	Different Forms of Polymorphism	In the previous post I teased a little about vtables, how they work, and whether people were familiar with them. Before I go into detail into that I'd like to rehash the notion of polymorphism first. It may be obvious already to OOP programmers or at least those who have been educated about OOP even without using it deeply. Then I go into how vtables work, why they're there, and what good vtables allow programmers to do in C++. Even if you already know all these things, I'd be interested to find out what you think about the content of this post -- comments and discussion would be most appreciated!First things first. Let's deal with the object-oriented notion of Polymorphism. Polymorphism is achieved in OOP by treating multiple (related) types as if they were the same. Polymorphism is almost literally translated to "many forms". Here's a simple example of the OOP implementation of Polymorphism in C++11 using inheritance and virtual methods:View in GitHub This is very simple, elementary OOP. We have classes Book and Door and they inherit from and override virtual methods in Object. We treat Book and Door like they were normal Objects. We have a function called "print" that lives alone and can print a reference to an Object.This is what is called the "substitutability" principle, where we can substitute any type that's derived from Object and treat it as we would an Object. There's more nuances with pure abstract types and even final types (for which no other type can be substituted) but you get the idea.There are a few questions that arise in this design though. Let's explore some of these questions:Can I treat instances of Object and instances of types derived from Object as I would an int? (Regular Types)Can I put objects of types derived from Object in a container of Object's? (Value Semantics)If I have a type that "looks" like an Object, can I also treat it as an Object? If I can't how can I work around that? (Concepts)For OOP, these questions get really hard to answer.Is there a different way?The other kind of polymorphism is Conceptual polymorphism. This is you might be familiar with if you've done anything with templates and concepts. The idea is to define requirements supported by types instead of looking at relationships between types, to determine whether an algorithm/function can be applied to instances of a given type. That's a lot of words, but code works best.View in GitHubWe take the Book and Door types and we define the concept of an Object. This definition goes like this:A type is an Object if it can be default constructed, can be copied, and accepts the no-argument print message (has a member function named print that doesn't take arguments).Now let's see how we can implement this in C++11:So, not much changed -- but if you squint you'll see a few things. First, the inheritance is gone! We just turned the print function into a template. We see that this works quite well for unrelated types, and we've now got a "generic" print function. Let's then try answering the questions we raised before in the OOP section above:Can we treat instances of Object (or O in this case) as we do int's? Yes, as long as O is a regular type.We have types that "look" like an Object (or more directly, types that model the Object concept), can I treat each one as I would an Object? Yes!Can we put objects of types that model the Object concept in the same container? No (at least not yet).Oh darn -- we're missing that part of putting things of the same concept in the same container. This is a little embarrassing, but then is there a way to do this? Let's look at our options.First option is we can use "type erasure" to do the trick. However this still almost requires some sort of inheritance-based polymorphism. This doesn't sound so value-semantic and polymorphic (we'll look at this again later).Second option is we can stick with the inheritance-based polymorphism and use std::unique_ptr in the container. In C++11 this is a completely valid option but it doesn't allow you to treat the objects referred to as values -- you're now relying on reference semantics to maintain identity. In most situations and in purely OOP design, you can stop here and just take the hit.Is there a third option? Can we mix the two ideas together and achieve what we want in the end, which is objects of different types being stored in the same container?Effectively we're going to have to be a little more creative. We can actually use both&nbsp;approaches to achieve what we want in the end: dealing with values, supporting polymorphism, removing the explicit inheritance, and then getting to the juice.Before we go there, we make a little detour into vtables.In essence, the way dynamic polymorphism (polymorphism via inheritance) works is through virtual functions, and under the hood they're represented as a table of function pointers. Each instance of a type that has virtual functions in its bases and its declaration will typically have a part of the object's storage in memory dedicated to a pointer to a table of function pointers mapping a function's signature to a function pointer. Compiler vendors may implement virtual tables differently and the C++ standard doesn't define the layout of virtual tables.You can find out more about virtual tables (or vtables in short) if you reach for your favorite search engine and look up [vtable]. There are a lot of good articles on the web about it, but the gist is that's how virtual function calls determine which actual function to invoke at runtime via inheritance-based polymorphism.Contrast this to how templates work and how the polymorphism is really happening at compile-time. There's no type erasure going on and there's no dynamic lookup at runtime of which function to actually call, because the compiler knows at compile time exactly which function it needs to execute at the point where the function is invoked. There's no need for a vtable in the concepts-based world.Or is there?Let's explore the possibility of putting instances of Object, Book, and Door in the same container by combining type erasure (inheritance-based polymorphism) and static dispatch (concept-based polymorphism). We're also going to be creative with how we define the container holding the values all together and get creative with how we implement some auxiliary "helper" functions for each type.Intermission: this borrows a lot from Sean Parent's talk at C++Now, where he goes about it in greater detail. If you haven't yet, watch his talk on YouTube.We change the previous listing and remove the template function "print" and instead we add the following:View in GitHubNow we've gotten two things working together: type erasure (we see object_concept_t, embodied as an abstract type, and an opaque object_t type that can hold different kinds of objects that can be printed) and static dispatch -- the compiler knows exactly which "print" to call at the top level. Let's re-examine our earlier questions here:Can we treat instances of object_t as we do int's? Yes!We have types that model the Object concept, can I treat each one as I would an Object? Yes!Can we put objects of types that model the Object concept in the same container? Yes!The good part about this approach is that when you have a new type that has a "print" function, you can suddenly add instances of the same type (so long as it's copy+move constructible+assignable) to the container above. This is powerful because now you're dealing with values exclusively -- instances of object_t have value semantics.If you look closely though we're still relying on the compiler's vtable implementation because we still have virtual functions in object_concept_t. Can we get rid of those?That's the subject of the next post. Hopefully you've gotten enough in this post to chew on and discuss going forward. I invite you to consider thinking about whether this can be useful in your codebase so that you can better leverage value semantics and get the benefits of type erasure as well as concept-based design. Do you think it would be nice if you never had to do inheritance-based polymorphism when you're designing your classes? How much easier would it be to extend your programs using this approach?I've love to know what you think in the comments.Thanks for reading!\r\n             \r\n	Cpp Soup	http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/CppSoup/~3/ZnaO0dumMpI/different-forms-of-polymorphism.html	Article	3
52	2012-09-14 11:38:00	C++11 -- The Time is Now	All the compiler vendors are racing to get C++11 features supported. There's currently a C++ "arms race" that's only benefitting users and the community at large. I don't currently have the time to survey the various language features and library implementations available out there so I'll leave that out for later. In the meantime I'd like to encourage everyone who's been waiting to use C++11 features and can get them from their compilers to go ahead and do it. In this post I list down some of the reasons why it makes sense to depend on C++11 now more than ever.The LandscapeCurrently we have three major compilers out there getting attention and fast iteration releases supporting more and more of C++11: MSVC, Clang, and GCC. I haven't kept abreast of the features that each one of these compilers support but it's interesting to see that more and more of C++11 is becoming available to more people.Much of C++11 features that get the most usage I would imagine are the ones that don't require too much changes to current code and mental models. Things like lambda's are really powerful and as far as I know all three compilers already support them in their latest two releases. This makes using the STL algorithms a lot easier. Another is range-based for loops. To those already doing template metaprogramming things like function template default arguments, auto, decltype, and variadic templates along with all sorts of new SFINAE tricks are going to make life a lot easier.We already have experts writing about the new hotness that is move semantics. This will take a little more time to become well understood by a lot of C++ programmers. Just the differentiation between rvalue references and lvalue references might not make it easily understandable -- as I don't think there's any other programming language out there that has these concepts. Variadic macros I hear are really powerful but I've never really fully understood the preprocessor so I tend to stay away from it. The seeming duality of constexpr functions -- does it execute at compile time or does it execute at runtime? -- makes it all the more exciting.Then there's concurrency which ushers the new era of a number of different programming styles aiming to take advantage of the boom in making sure you're using all the cores available on your machine. Instead of just&nbsp;counting the cycles on a single code now you're thinking about cache-line alignment of objects and atomic operations as well as which memory model you're going to leverage. Gone are the days where you just think about the processor pipeline but now you also have to think about the NUMA channels, the L1/L2/L3 caches, and even the OS VM implementation.Uncharted TerritoryIn my personal opinion I think we are at the edge of the known and understood parts of C++ programming. Up to now there's been good understanding of the features we have available to us but then we get to a position where we're trying to push the boundaries. The people who designed lambdas and the concurrency model understand that we can execute the lambda's in user-created and managed thread-pools. We still don't know though whether someone comes up with clever lambda programming that will simulate a LISP machine that's actually concurrency-aware (yes, I'm just making that up).We still don't understand how constexpr will actually change the way people wrote functions in C++ -- will everyone then try to isolate their non-mutable computations that may be statically optimized away by the compiler into constexpr functions? We don't know what the effect of that on compilation times might be, or whether someone will actually just come up with an embedded compiler engine that knows how to do constexpr evaluation on the fly (yes I'm just making that up). Also we don't know whether we can get purely compile-time programs that don't look like template metaprograms but that look like "regular C++" that just so happens to be executed at compile-time.Then there's domain-specific embedded languages. I can already see lambda's being named, composed, and with the help of constexpr maybe even evaluated/expanded at compile-time -- not sure how feasible that is though. Now that it's relatively easier to do perfect forwarding in C++11 libraries like Boost.Proto (which I maintain is a work of pure genius) and Boost.Spirit (which is still the most awesome library I've ever seen implemented) I'm excited to see better error messages and even more efficient implementations going forward. I would love to see a C++11 aware DSEL that works with user-defined literals instead of just operator overloading.The future of C++ sounds uncomfortably exciting and I'm looking forward to the next generation of programmers who will grow up and use C++11 as the only C++ they ever knew and hope they come up with even more awesome things that the current experts already have come up with. I'm willing to be a spectator and perhaps even a participant in this future.Challenges of RealityIt's fun to dream and hope for better tools and better libraries. Unfortunately there's the problem of reality: how to we get to that point?My suggestion is three-fold:Use the language. Find out whether you're noticing that there's certain new idioms that you're discovering. See whether using the new features to solve old problems makes the old problem easier to solve. Migrate your code to use the new features in places where it makes sense (or even where they don't just to have a feel for what works and what doesn't).Share your findings. Let the world know how you find the features. It's not always going to be good -- there are still some WTF's with certain changes to the language around some things. If you make your problems known to more people the more chances other people will help you out. I'm impressed with the communities that have been built around Ruby, Python, and JavaScript -- they aren't afraid to share their experiences and findings with the whole world. C++11 is so awesome that it deserves a community around it too in my opinion.Get involved in the process. You say you would like a networking library? Let your friendly neighborhood C++ committee member know. We're here to listen and take suggestions. If you point us to the direction where you think C++ should go, we're all ears. I for one would like first-class reflection/introspection both statically and at runtime in standard C++ -- it's not too hard to get your proposal heard and even championed by people that are on the committee. Let's all work together to make the next version of C++ even more awesome than the current one.I hope you'll join me in getting the word out that C++11 is worth the effort and is ultimately a better C++ for everyone. I'd gladly love to hear what you think.This is the first post since March 22, 2012 -- I'm sorry for being too busy to share my thoughts with the larger community. I can't promise much but I definitely will strive to write more about C++.\r\n             \r\n	Cpp Soup	http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/CppSoup/~3/XiXbPpZHH8I/c11-time-is-now.html	Article	3
61	2011-08-04 04:36:00	cpp-netlib 0.9.1 Released!	Today marks another important day in my calendar as I'm proud to announce the general availability of cpp-netlib 0.9.1. You can now download the source packages from the Github download page. If you want to see what's new you can head on to the online documentation page for what's new in 0.9.1. This release fixes a number of issues with 0.9.0 so if you're still using 0.9.0 you might want to upgrade to 0.9.1. That's not the only reason 0.9.1 is good though, and the rest of this post is about giving a little bit more insight into what's new and what's coming in the coming months for the C++ Network Library project.For all intents and purposes, 0.9.1 should really be version 1.0 -- but there are a few things holding it back from becoming ready for prime-time as a 1.0 version. Here's a list of things that are in there that makes the release extra special:\tSupport for streaming body callback handler in HTTP client requests. This means you can perform HTTP client requests and pass a callback function that gets called every time a chunk of data is available from the connection. This allows you to handle larger response bodies without having to fit all the data in memory. This is important for implementing downloaders that need to save data straight to a file or in general when you just want to not have to wait for all the data to be put in memory before processing it. You can find out more about this by reading the updated HTTP Client reference documentation.\tDefault HTTP client is now asynchronous. This release switches the default HTTP client implementation defined at boost::network::http::client to use the asynchronous features. There are no changes required to the original code that used the default HTTP client implementation, but linking to the new version may require you to link in Boost.Thread. You can easily change the default tag by overriding the BOOST_NETWORK_HTT_DEFAULT_TAG macro at compile time or before you include any cpp-netlib header.\tTons of bug fixes from 0.9.0. You can find the list of issues that have been closed on the GitHub issues page. Needless to say the amount of changes that went into the library between 0.9.0 and 0.9.1 are pretty substantial that would have merited a major number advance, but there are more good things in store to wait for to get into 1.0.The list above is pretty packed but I'd also like to update everyone on some good news regarding the cpp-netlib project. Needless to say they should be treated as great news but I'm not one for exaggeration. Here are a few updates:\tThere's now a git mirror up on Google Code Project Hosting. At some point in the future -- depending on how large the community grows and/or whether there's popular support for it -- the Google Code Project Hosting site may just become the de-facto development repository of the project. You can find the Google Code Project here.\tI'm now officially working on cpp-netlib as my 20% project in Google! This means I can now devote a measurable amount of time and effort into making sure the project succeeds. This doesn't change the project goals and ideals but hopefully it does change the pace of development as I get more effort into it.\tI'm looking to expand the developer pool by offering to mentor interested developers who want to learn the techniques and be part of the project. Since cpp-netlib is not my 100% time project in Google I'm not going to be able to do all the fun work that still needs to be done to make cpp-netlib better. Good news is that I'm making myself available to help mentor developers to get up to speed on the project and have more people eventually able to contribute to the effort.\tI've found a willing review manager for cpp-netlib's eventual review for inclusion in the Boost C++ Library. It's going to be just a matter of time now before the review is scheduled and I'm able to set time aside to get the review done and over with. The project will continue to evolve and develop even outside of Boost following the Boost.Spirit and Boost.Asio model and hopefully get more people contributing to Boost through the cpp-netlib project.If you're interested in the mentoring, please join the cpp-netlib Google group and introduce yourself. Let everyone on the list know what you want to learn and what part of the library or project you want to be involved in. We're currently looking for people who are willing to:\tTest the library on the major development platforms. Right now we're only concentrating on Linux and Mac with GCC and Clang, and we're looking for people willing to test on Windows and/or other platforms.\tUpdate the look and layout of the website. This doesn't require much C++ knowledge but should be proficient with HTML, CSS, and has better design aesthetics than I do.\tRead/update the documentation. Feedback on the documentation and what's lacking are very important.\tImplement new features and/or refactor the internals of the library. This part will be involved and is where I would be doing most of the mentoring and hand-holding as much as necessary.Thanks for reading so far down and I do hope you'll help spread the word about the new release.Cheers from down under!\r\n             \r\n	Cpp Soup	http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/CppSoup/~3/9DNxWzTS96c/cpp-netlib-091-released.html	Article	3
69	2015-11-14 00:00:00	Covariance and Contravariance in C++ Standard Library	\n\nCovariance and Contravariance are concepts that come up often as you go deeper into generic programming. While designing a language that supports parametric polymorphism (e.g., templates in C++, generics in Java, C#), the language designer has a choice between Invariance, Covariance, and Contravariance when dealing with generic types. C++'s choice is "invariance". Let's look at an example. \n\nstruct Vehicle {};\nstruct Car : Vehicle {};\n\nstd::vector vehicles;\nstd::vector cars;\n\nvehicles = cars; // Does not compile\n\n\nThe above program does not compile because C++ templates are invariant. Of course, each time a C++ template is instantiated, the compiler creates a brand new type that uniquely represents that instantiation. Any other type to the same template creates another unique type that has nothing to do with the earlier one. Any two unrelated user-defined types in C++ can't be assigned to each-other by default. You have to provide a copy-constructor or an assignment operator. \n\n\nHowever, the fun starts when you realize that it's just a choice and there are other valid choices. In fact, C++ makes a different choice for pointers and references. For example, it's common knowledge that pointer of type Car is assignable to pointer of type Vehicle. That's because Car is a subtype of Vehicle. More accurately, the Car struct inherits from the Vehicle struct and the compiler allows us to use Car pointers in places where Vehicle pointer is expected. I.e., subtyping is activated through inheritance. Later in the post we will use subtyping without using inheritance.\n\nIf you think about pointers as a shortcut for the Pointer template below, it becomes apparent that the language has some special rules for them. Don't let the special * syntax confuse you. It is just a shortcut to avoid the ceremony below.\n\ntemplate \nusing Pointer = T *;\n\nPointer vehicle;\nPointer car;\n\nvehicle = car; // Works!\n\n\nSo what choices are available? The question we want to ask ourselves is, "What relationship do I expect between instantiations of a template with two different types that happen to have a subtype relationship?"\n\nThe first choice is no relationship. I.e., the template instantiations completely ignore the relationship between parameter types. This is C++ default. It's called invariance. (a.k.a. C++ templates are invariant)\nThe second choice is covariant. I.e., the template instantiations have the same subtype relationship as the parameter types. This is seen in C++ pointers and also in std::shared_ptr, std::unique_ptr because they want to behave as much like pointers as possible. You have write special code to enable that because the language does not give it to you by default.\nThe third choice is contravariance. I.e., the template instantiations have the opposite subtype relationship to that of the parameter types. I.e., TEMPLATE is subtype of TEMPLATE. We'll come back to contravariance in much more detail later in the post.\n\n\nAll C++ standard library containers are invariant (even if they contain pointers).\n\nCovariance\n\nAs said earlier, with covariance, the templated type maintains the relationship between argument types. I.e., if argument types are unrelated, the templated types shall be unrelated. If derived is a sub-type of  base (expressed as inheritance) then TEMPLATE shall be sub-type of TEMPLATE. I.e., any place where TEMPLATE is expected, TEMPLATE can be substituted and everything will work just fine. The other way around is not allowed.\n\nThere are some common examples of covariance in C++ standard library.\n\nstd::shared_ptr shptr_vehicle;\nstd::shared_ptr shptr_car;\nshptr_vehicle = shptr_car; // Works\nshptr_car = shptr_vehicle' // Does not work.\n\nstd::unique_ptr unique_vehicle;\nstd::unique_ptr unique_car;\nunique_vehicle = std::move(unique_car); // Works\nunique_car = std::move(unique_vehicle); // Does not work\n\n\nOne (formal) way to think about covariance is that "the type is allowed to get bigger upon assignment". I.e., Vehicle is broader/bigger type than Car. \n\nHere's a quick rundown of some of the commonly used C++ standard library types and their covariance/contravariance properties.\n\n\n\nTypeCovariantContravariant\n\nSTL containersNoNo\nstd::initializer_listNoNo\nstd::futureNoNo\nboost::optionalNo (see note below)No\nstd::shared_ptrYesNo\nstd::unique_ptrYesNo\nstd::pairYesNo\nstd::tupleYesNo\nstd::atomicYesNo\nstd::functionYes (in return)Yes (in arguments)\n\n\nThe boost::optional appears to be covariant but it really isn't because it slices the object underneath. The same thing happens with std::pair and std::tuple. Therefore, they behave covariantly correctly only when the parameter type itself behaves covariantly. \n\nFinally, Combining one covariant type with another (e.g., std::shared_ptr) does not necessarily preserve covariance because it is not built into the language. It is often implemented as a single-level direct convertibility. I.e., std::tuple * is not directly convertible to std::tuple *. It would have been if the language itself enforced subtyping between std::tuple and std::tuple but it does not. On the other hand, std::tuple behaves covariantly.\n\n\nBy "single-level direct convertibility", I mean the following conversion of U* to T*. Convertibility is poor man's test for subtyping in C++. \n\n\nA covariant SmartPointer might be implemented as follows. \n\ntemplate \nclass SmartPointer\n{\npublic:\n    template \n    SmartPointer(U* p) : p_(p) {}\n\n    template \n    SmartPointer(const SmartPointer& sp,\n                 typename std::enable_if::type * = 0) \n      : p_(sp.p_) {}\n\n    template \n    typename std::enable_if::type \n    operator=(const SmartPointer & sp)\n    {\n        p_ = sp.p_;\n        return *this;\n    }\n\n   T* p_;\n};\n\n\nContravariance\n\nContravariance, as it turns out, is quite counter-intuitive and messes up with your brain. But it is a very valid choice when it comes to selecting how generic types behave. Before we deal with contravariance, lets quickly revisit a very old C++ feature: covariant return types. \n\nConsider the following class hierarchy.\n\n\nclass VehicleFactory {\n  public:\n    virtual Vehicle * create() const { return new Vehicle(); }\n    virtual ~VehicleFactory() {}\n};\n\nclass CarFactory : public VehicleFactory {\npublic:\n    virtual Car * create() const override { return new Car(); }\n};\n\nNote that the return value of VehicleFactory::create function is Vehicle * where as CarFactory::create is Car *. This is allowed. The CarFactory::create function overrides its parent's virtual function. This feature is called overriding with covariant return types.\n\nWhat happens when you change the raw pointers to std::shared_ptr? Is it still a valid program?....\n\nAs it turns out, it's not. std::shared_ptr (or any simulated covariant type for that matter) can't fool the compiler into believing that the two functions have covariant return types. The compiler rejects the code because as far as it knows, only the pointer types (and references too) have built-in covariance and nothing else. \n\nLets look a these two factories from the substitutability perspective. The client of VehicleFactory (which has no knowledge of CarFactory) can use VehicleFactory safely even if the create function gets dispatched to CarFactory at run-time. After all, the create function return something that can be treated like a vehicle. No concrete details about Car are necessary for the client to work correctly. That's just classic Object-oriented programming.\n \nCovariance appears to work fine for return types of overridden functions. How about the argument? Is there some sort of variance possible? Does C++ support it? Does it make sense outside C++? \n\nLet's change the create function to accept Iron * as raw material. Obviously, the CarFactory::create must also accept an argument of type Iron *. It is supposed to work and it does. That's old hat. \n\nWhat if CarFactory is so advanced that it takes any Metal and creates a Car? Consider the following.\n\nstruct Vehicle {};\nstruct Car : Vehicle {};\n\nstruct Metal {};\nstruct Iron : Metal {};\n\nclass VehicleFactory {\n  public:\n    virtual Vehicle * create(Iron *) const { return new Vehicle(); }\n    virtual ~VehicleFactory() {}\n};\n\nclass CarFactory : public VehicleFactory {\npublic:\n    virtual Car * create(Metal *) const override { return new Car(); }\n};\n\nThe above program is illegal C++. The CarFactory::create does not override anything in its base class and therefore due to the override keyword compiler rejects the code. Without override, the program compiles but you are looking at two completely separate functions marked virtual but really they won't do what you expect. \n\nMore interesting question is whether it makes sense to override a function in a way that the argument in the derived function is broader/larger than that of the bases's?...\n\nWelcome to Contravariance...\nIt totally does make sense and this language feature is called contravariant argument types. From the perspective of the client of VehicleFactory, the client needs to provide some Iron. The CarFactory not only accepts Iron but any Metal to make a Car. So the Client works just fine. \n\nNote the reversed relationship in the argument types. The derived create function accepts the broader type because it must do at least as much as the base's function is able to do. This reverse relationship is the crux of contravariance.\n\n\nC++ does not have built-in support for contravariant argument types. So that's how it ends for C++? Of course not!\n\n\nCovariant Return Types and Contravariant Argument Types in std::function\nOK, the heading gives it away so lets get right down to an example.\n\ntemplate \nusing Sink = std::function;\n\nSink vehicle_sink = [](Vehicle *){ std::cout < "Got some vehicle\\n"; };\nSink	C++ truths	http://cpptruths.blogspot.co.il/2015/11/covariance-and-contravariance-in-c.html	Article	3

They also point out syntactic and semantic differences between "official" SQL and the SQL you're probably using.  \n\nPulling off that kind of feat calls for lots of experience, both with SQL and with explaining it to others. Authors John Viescas, Doug Steele, and Ben Clothier have it in spades. They're pushing a century of IT experience (!), and they've published more than a half-dozen books on databases, SQL, or both.

The signature of the handler depends on the type of operation. For example, a handler posted using io_service::post() must have the signature:void handler();while an asynchronous wait operation expects:void handler(error_code ec);and asynchronous read/write operations want:void handler(error_code ec, size_t length);Non-trivial applications will need to pass some context to the completion handler, such as a this pointer. One way to do this is to use a function object adapter like boost::bind, std::tr1::bind or (as of C++0x) std::bind.Unfortunately, for many C++ programmers, bind represents a little bit of magic. This is not helped by the impenetrable compiler errors that confront you when you use it incorrectly. And, in my experience, the underlying concept (where some function arguments are bound up-front, while others are delayed until the point of call) can present quite a steep learning curve.I have put together some diagrams to help explain how bind works. For clarity, I have taken a few liberties with C++ syntax (e.g. omitting the parameter types on the function call operator) and (over-)simplified bind's implementation. Finally, the examples are limited to those likely to be useful with Asio. Comments and suggestions welcome.bind can be used to adapt a user-supplied function expecting one argument into a function object that takes zero arguments. The bound value (123 in this example) is stored in a function object and is automatically passed to the user-supplied function as required:[ click images for full size ]Binding an argument can be used to turn a class member function into a zero-argument function object. As you know, non-static member functions have an implicit this parameter. This means that an appropriate pointer needs to be bound into the function object:Alternatively, the implicit this can be made explicit by adapting a member function into a function object taking one argument:Function objects will often use both bound arguments and arguments supplied at the point of use. This can be done using member functions:or non-member functions:Sometimes the function object's point of use will supply arguments which are not required to call the target function. bind will automatically discard these surplus arguments:The surplus argument(s) need not be the at the end of the function object signature:Finally, bind allows you to the reorder arguments to adapt the target function to the necessary function object signature:\n\n	Thinking Asynchronously in C++	http://blog.think-async.com/2010/04/bind-illustrated.html	Article	3

44	2012-10-30 14:03:00	Value Semantics and Polymorphism	Lately I've been interested in formalising the notion of value semantics for one reason or another. I've been in email conversations with other people who have been interested in making value semantics and value-oriented programming the norm in C++. There's a great debate to be had on whether object oriented programming is really the right way of building secure, scalable, and correct&nbsp;software solutions. This post is not about that debate but it is about how a different way of thinking may get more people understanding (and liking) how it is to think about values. In the previous post I wrote about design as computation. In this one I think about one way of designing computation.I've already raved about Elements of Programming by Alex Stepanov before but if there's any one chapter you should read in that book is the first one. The succeeding chapters build on the first but what's really important in the first chapter is the fact that once you understand how to think about values, you can start understanding how to really use the STL and how you can start getting more and more into the practice of generic programming. Even though the book is not really about generic programming, it is a glimpse into a fundamentally different way of thinking.Let's take something dear to the Object Oriented Programming model and look at it in a different perspective. If you have heard the term polymorphism&nbsp;before you pretty much think about base classes and virtual functions in C++. You're probably already thinking that the only way to do polymorphism in C++ would be through virtual functions -- and you may be forgiven in thinking that runtime polymorphism is best modeled through virtual functions and inheritance. This is however just one way of looking at the world.How else you ask would you think about polymorphism? I've lately been glad to watch Sean Parent's talk at C++Now via YouTube where he explores a different kind of polymorphic typing using concepts. If you have two hours to spare learning about how to implement something as complex as Photoshop's history functionality using vectors and values, I suggest you stop reading now and watch that video first.The whole idea that you can do a lot with representing things as just values is sometimes mind-boggling. I personally have been comfortable with value semantics but I've always found myself needing inheritance based polymorphism at some point. There were times that I was able to get away with not using runtime polymorphism but it always seemed to be forced&nbsp;or unnatural. The interesting thing is that once you see one example of how it can be done, then the gears start turning in your head and you find that some problems you've encountered before you can actually see in a different light.What I found fascinating are the following points which I want to discuss in further detail going forward in the next few articles:Design with copies in mind. Once you can reason about values then the simpler your programming model becomes.Know when to move. Copies and optimisations on copies is one thing, it's another to know when it's better to move. Understanding how moves work is crucial in getting this right.Avoid shared state. This is easier said than done, but if you design with copies and values&nbsp;in mind then shared state becomes a code smell and something you should start avoiding if you want to be able to reason about your code locally.Find the abstraction and leverage it ruthlessly. Sometimes the simplest abstractions are the best ones to build more complex abstractions on, while complex abstractions become harder to conceptualise when you keep it simple.I'm going to enjoy writing about the above four points in detail in the coming articles. In the meantime I leave you with a question:Do you know what vtables are? Do you know how they work? If you answer yes to both, can you simulate vtables and use templates to adapt a set of types onto a concept? If you don't know what vtables are, can you make an adapter type that adheres to a non-virtual interface but still allows you to have different implementations at runtime?\r\n             \r\n	Cpp Soup	http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/CppSoup/~3/yN_YVUD0dTU/value-semantics-and-polymorphism.html	Article	3
59	2012-03-21 13:32:00	The C++ Network Library: New Release and Updates	After a bit of development (and a little stagnation) since the 0.9.2 release, I'm proud to announce that cpp-netlib 0.9.3 is now available for general availability. This release will be supported for one year until March 30, 2013. You can download the official packages from the Github project downloads. This release was managed by Glyn Matthews and there are a number of important changes in 0.9.3 that addresses issues with 0.9.2. There are a number of bugs fixed and lots of simplifications internally.Here's a quick run-down of what has changed between 0.9.2 and 0.9.3:Static libraries for URI and HTTP Client connections. This dramatically reduces the compile-time costs of using the HTTP client and the URI parsers.A new interface for building URIs. The URI builder follows the directive style that's used in the request and response objects.Fixes to C++0x/C++11-supporting compilers (MSVC 2010 in particular).Updates to the MIME parser implementation.There are a few issues that are being worked on and we're planning on doing a 0.9.4 release or a patch-set for 0.9.3. If you do find issues we encourage you to file them on the official project issue tracker.The next major release we're planning will feature the move away from and removing support for the header-only implementation. There's also a discussion on the mailing list about what the focus for the development of the library should be moving forward. If you're interested in the topic, you can checkout the discussion on the mailing list.Major changes are going to come from my personal fork of the project. I've just recently completed the refactoring of the HTTP client implementation to make it easier to maintain and extend. In lieu of header-only template metaprogramming, I've made changes to use traditional polymorphism in places where they make sense. This allows us to maintain a stable interface against which other developers can program against to implement many new techniques that users can choose to customize the behavior of the HTTP client.We're still in the process of planning whether we're going to release a 0.10 which contains these changes or whether we're going to straight to 1.0. C++11 support is also something the community is looking to jump to. We'd love to hear what the users think, so feel free to post comments on this post or better yet join the mailing list to get involved in the discussion.In the meantime we're hoping to get more users and more contributors to the project. Although we are too late for applying to the Google Summer of Code effort, we are ramping up our efforts to get more contributors involved in the project. I'm personally putting in my 20% time to make sure that I can mentor new developers and make myself available to allow people who want to contribute to answer questions on the mailing list. I'm also going to be hosting regular hang-outs as well for live face-to-face interaction with users and developers in the community.The goal of cpp-netlib has definitely changed now from something that's just a header-only modern C++ networking library to making modern C++ network programming easy for everyone. We encourage users and developers alike to raise ideas and questions to the mailing list so that we can as a community make network programming in C++ easier and more accessible to more people. It is also with this goal that we're hoping to get a proposal to the ISO C++ Committee for a high-level HTTP client interface accepted.In behalf of the C++ Network Library group of maintainers and community members, we look forward to getting more contributors and users this year and in the coming years. We're all committed to achieving the new goals of the project and look forward to your feedback and patronage.Cheers!\r\n             \r\n	Cpp Soup	http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/CppSoup/~3/qcs4i8Luwwo/c-network-library-new-release-and.html	Article	3

100	2015-11-13 00:00:00	Breaking all the Eggs in C++	\n\nIf you want to make an omelet, so the saying goes, you have to break a few eggs. Think of the omelet you could make if you broke not just a few eggs, but all of them! Then think of what it'd be like to not just break them, but to replace them with newer, better eggs. That's what this post is about: breaking all the eggs in C++, yet ending up with better eggs than you started with.\n\nNULL, 0, and nullptr \nNULL came from C. It interfered with type-safety (it depends on an implicit conversion from void* to typed pointers), so C++ introduced 0 as a better way to express null pointers. That led to problems of its own, because 0 isn't a pointer, it's an int. C++11 introduced nullptr, which embodies the idea of a null pointer better than NULL or 0. Yet NULL and 0-as-a-null-pointer remain valid. Why? If nullptr is better than both of them, why keep the inferior ways around?\n\nBackward-compatibility, that's why. Eliminating NULL and 0-as-a-null-pointer would break existing programs. In fact, it would probably break every egg in C++'s basket. Nevertheless, I'm suggesting we get rid of NULL and 0-as-a-null-pointer, thus eliminating the confusion and redundancy inherent in having three ways to say the same thing (two of which we discourage people from using). \n\nBut read on.\n\nUninitialized Memory \nIf I declare a variable of a built-in type and I don't provide an initializer, the variable is sometimes automatically set to zero (null for pointers). The rules for when "zero initialization" takes place are well defined, but they're a pain to remember. Why not just zero-initialize all built-in types that aren't explicitly initialized, thus eliminating not only the pain of remembering the rules, but also the suffering associated with debugging problems stemming from uninitialized variables?\n\nBecause it can lead to unnecessary work at runtime. There's no reason to set a variable to zero if, for example, the first thing you do is pass it to a routine that assigns it a value.\n\nSo let's take a page out of D's book (in particular, page 30 of The D Programming Language) and zero-initialize built-ins by default, but specify that void as an initial value prevents initialization: \n\nint x;              // always zero-initialized\nint x = void;       // never zero-initialized\n\nThe only effect such a language extension would have on existing code would be to change the initial value of some variables from indeterminate (in cases where they currently would not be zero-initialized) to specified (they would be zero-initialized). That doesn't lead to any backward-compatibility problems in the traditional sense, but I can assure you that some people will still object. Default zero initialization could lead to a few more instructions being executed at runtime (even taking into account compilers' ability to optimize away dead stores), and who wants to tell  developers of a finely-tuned safety-critical realtime embedded system (e.g., a pacemaker) that their code might now execute some instructions they didn't plan on?\n\nI do. Break those eggs!\n\nThis does not make me a crazy man. Keep reading.\n\nstd::list::remove and std::forward_list::remove\nTen standard containers offer a member function that eliminates all elements with a specified value (or, for map containers, a specified key): list, forward_list, set, multiset, map, multimap, unordered_set, unordered_multiset, unordered_map, unordered_multimap. In eight of these ten containers, the member function is named erase. In list and forward_list, it's named remove. This is inconsistent in two ways. First, different containers use different member function names to accomplish the same thing. Second, the meaning of "remove" as an algorithm is different from that as a container member function: the remove algorithm can't eliminate any container elements, but the remove member functions can.\n\nWhy do we put up with this inconsistency? Because getting rid of it would break code. Adding a new erase member function to list and forward_list would be easy enough, and it would eliminate the first form of inconsistency, but getting rid of the remove member functions would render code calling them invalid. I say scramble those eggs!\n\nHold your fire. I'm not done yet.\n\noverride \nC++11's override specifier enables derived classes to make explicit which functions are meant to override virtual functions inherited from base classes. Using override makes it possible for compilers to diagnose a host of overriding-relating errors, and it makes derived classes easier for programmers to understand. I cover this in my trademark scintillating fashion (ahem) in Item 12 of Effective Modern C++, but in a blog post such as this, it seems tacky to refer to something not available online for free, and that Item isn't available for free--at least not legally. So kindly allow me to refer you to this article as well as this StackOverflow entry for details on how using override improves your code.\n\nGiven the plusses that override brings to C++, why do we allow overriding functions to be declared without it? Making it possible for compilers to check for overriding errors is nice, but why not require that they do it? It's not like we make type checking optional, n'est-ce pas?\n\nYou know where this is going. Requiring that overriding functions be declared override would cause umpty-gazillion lines of legacy C++ to stop compiling, even though all that code is perfectly correct. If it ain't broke, don't fix it, right? Wrong!, say I. Those old functions may work fine, but they aren't as clear to class maintainers as they could be, and they'll cause inconsistency in code bases as newer classes embrace the override lifestyle. I advocate cracking those eggs wide open.\n\nBackward Compatibility \n\nDon't get me wrong. I'm on board with the importance of backward compatibility. Producing software that works is difficult and expensive, and changing it is time-consuming and error-prone. It can also be dangerous. There's a reason I mentioned pacemakers above: I've worked with companies who use C++ as part of pacemaker systems. Errors in that kind of code can kill people. If the Standardization Committee is going to make decisions that outlaw currently valid code (and that's what I'd like to see it do), it has to have a very good reason.\n\n\n\nOr maybe not. Maybe a reason that's merely decent suffices as long as existing code can be brought into conformance with a revised C++ specification in a way that's automatic, fast, cheap, and reliable. If I have a magic wand that allows me to instantly and flawlessly take all code that uses NULL and 0 to specify null pointers and revises the code to use nullptr instead, where's the downside to getting rid of NULL and 0-as-a-null-pointer and revising C++ such that the only way to specify a null pointer is nullptr? Legacy code is easily updated (the magic wand works instantly and flawlessly), and we don't have to explain to new users why there are three ways to say the same thing, but they shouldn't use two of them. Similarly, why allow overriding functions without override if the magic wand can instantly and flawlessly add override to existing code that lacks it?\n\n\n\nThe eggs in C++ that I want to break are the old ways of doing things--the ones the community now acknowledges should be avoided. NULL and 0-as-a-null-pointer are eggs that should be broken. So should variables with implicit indeterminate values. list::remove and forward_list::remove need to go, as do overriding functions lacking override. The newer, better eggs are nullptr, variables with indeterminate values only when expressly requested, list::erase and forward_list::erase, and override. \n\n\n\nAll we need is a magic wand that works instantly and flawlessly.\n\n\n\nIn general, that's a tall order, but I'm willing to settle for a wand with limited abilities. The flawless part is not up for negotiation. If the wand could break valid code, people could die. Under such conditions, it'd be irresponsible of the Standardization Committee to consider changing C++ without the above-mentioned very good reason. I want a wand that's so reliable, the Committee could responsibly consider changing the language for reasons that are merely decent.\n\n\n\nI'm willing to give ground on instantaneousness. The flawless wand must certainly run quickly enough to be practical for industrial-sized code bases (hundreds of millions of lines or more), but as long as it's practical for such code bases, I'm a happy guy. When it comes to speed, faster is better, but for the speed of the magic wand, good enough is good enough.\n\n\n\nThe big concession I'm willing to make regards the wand's expressive power. It need not perform arbitrary changes to C++ code bases. For Wand 1.0, I'm willing to settle for the ability to make localized source code modifications that are easy to algorithmically specify. All the examples I discussed above satisfy this constraint:\n\nThe wand should replace all uses of NULL and of 0 as a null pointer with nullptr. (This alone won't make it possible to remove NULL from C++, because experience has shown that some code bases exhibit "creative" uses of NULL, e.g., "char c = (char) NULL;". Such code typically depends on undefined behavior, so it's hard to feel too sympathetic towards it, but that doesn't mean it doesn't exist.)\nThe wand should replace all variable definitions that lack explicit initializers and that are currently not zero-initialized with an explicit initializer of void. \nThe wand should replace uses of list::remove and forward_list::remove with uses of list::erase and forward_list::erase. (Updating the container classes to support the new erase member functions would be done by humans, i.e. by STL implementers. That's not the wand's responsibility.)\nThe wand should add override to all overriding functions.\n\nEach of the transformations above are semantics-preserving: the revised code would have exactly the same behavior under C++ with the revisions I've suggested as it currently does under C++11 and C++14.\n\n\nClang\nThe magic wand exists--or at least the tool needed to make it does. It's called Clang. All hail Clang! Clang parses and performs semantic analysis on C++ source code, thus \nmaking it possible to write tools that modify C++ programs. Two of the \ntransformations I discussed above appear to be part of clang-tidy (the successor to clang-modernize): replacing NULL and 0 as null pointers with nullptr and adding override to overriding functions. That makes clang-tidy, if nothing else, a proof of concept. That has enormous consequences.\n\n\nRevisiting Backward Compatibility \nIn recent years, the Standardization Committee's approach to backward compatibility has been to preserve it at all costs unless (1) it could be demonstrated that only very little code would be broken and (2) the cost of the break was vastly overcompensated for by a feature enabled by the break. Hence the Committee's willingness to eliminate auto's traditional meaning in C and C++98 (thus making it possible to give it new meaning in C++11) and its C++11 adoption of the new keywords alignas, alignof, char16_t, char32_t, constexpr, decltype, noexcept, nullptr, static_assert, and thread_local.\n\nContrast this with the perpetual deprecation of setting bool variables to true by applying ++ to them. When C++14 was adopted, that construct had been deprecated for some 17 years, yet it remains part of C++. Given its lengthy stint on death row, it's hard to imagine that a lot of code still depends on it, but my guess is that the Committee sees nothing to be gained by actually getting rid of the "feature," so, failing part (2) of the break-backward-compatibility test, they leave it in.\n\nIncidentally, code using ++ to set a bool to true is another example of the kind of thing that a tool like clang-tidy should be able to easily perform. (Just replace the use of ++ with an assignment from true.)\n\nClang makes it possible for the Standardization Committee to retain its understandable reluctance to break existing code without being quite so conservative about how they do it. Currently, the way to avoid breaking legacy software is to ensure that language revisions don't affect it. The sole tool in the backward-compatibility toolbox is stasis: change nothing that could affect old code. It's a tool that works, and make no mistake about it, that's important. The fact that old C++ code continues to be valid in modern C++ is a feature of great importance to many users. It's not just the pacemaker programmers who care about it.\n\nClang's contribution is to give the Committee another way to ensure backward compatibility: by recognizing that tools can be written to automatically modify old code to conform to revised language specifications without any change in semantics. Such tools, provided they can be shown to operate flawlessly (i.e., they never produce transformed programs that behave any differently from the code they're applied to) and at acceptable speed for industrial-sized code bases, give the Standardization Committee more room to get rid of the parts of C++ where there's consensus that we'd rather not have them in the language.\n\nA Ten-Year Process\n\nHere's how I envision this working:\n\nStage 1a: The Standardization Committee identifies features of the language and/or standard library that they'd like to get rid of and whose use they believe can be algorithmically transformed into valid and semantically equivalent code in the current version or a soon-to-be-adopted version of C++. They publish a list of these features somewhere. The Standard is probably not the place for this list. Perhaps a technical report would be a suitable avenue for this kind of thing. \nStage 1b: Time passes, during which the community has the opportunity to develop tools like clang-tidy for the features identified in Stage 1a and to get experience with them on nontrivial code bases. As is the case with compilers and libraries, the community is responsible for implementing the tools, not the Committee.\nStage 2a: The Committee looks at the results of Stage 1b and reevaluates the desirability and feasibility of eliminating the features in question. For the features where they like what they see, they deprecate them in the next Standard.\nStage 2b: More time passes. The community gets more experience with the source code transformation tools needed to automatically convert bad eggs (old constructs) to good ones (the semantically equivalent new ones).\nStage 3: The Committee looks at the results of Stage 2b and again evaluates the desirability and feasibility of eliminating the features they deprecated in Stage 2a. Ideally, one of the things they find is that virtually all code that used to employ the old constructs has already been converted to use the new ones. If they deem it appropriate, they remove the deprecated features from C++. If they don't, they either keep them in a deprecated state (executing the moral equivalent of a goto to Stage 2b) or they eliminate their deprecated status. \n\nI figure that the process of getting rid of a feature will take about 10 years, where each stage takes about three years. That's based on the assumption that the Committee will continue releasing a new Standard about every three years.\n\nTen years may seem like a long time, but I'm not trying to optimize for speed. I'm simply trying to expand the leeway the Standardization Committee has in how they approach backward compatibility. Such compatibility has been an important factor in C++'s success, and it will continue to be so. \n\nOne Little Problem\nThe notion of algorithmically replacing one C++ construct with a different, but semantically equivalent, construct seems relatively straightforward, but that's only because I haven't considered the biggest, baddest, ruins-everythingest aspect of the C++-verse: macros. That's a subject for a post of its own, and I'll devote one to it in the coming days. [The post now exists here.] For now, I'm interested in your thoughts on the ideas above.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\n	The View From Aristeia	http://scottmeyers.blogspot.co.il/2015/11/breaking-all-eggs-in-c.html	Article	3

Want to know how to make things faster?  Fire up the profiler!\n\nI no longer think that way.  Now I think about optimizing the system.  (This recognition, in fact, has convinced me that I'm going to have to give Fastware! a new subtitle. It's currently "Straight Talk about Fast Code," which I think has a nice ring to it, but that's too codecentric.  I'll have to find a way to say something catchy that corresponds to "Straight Talk about Fast Systems." But I digress.)\n\nIn rare cases, the system is a single executable over which you have complete control, so, sure, fire up the profiler. More commonly, the system consists of multiple cooperating components, often broken across multiple executables.  Web-based systems, for example, may have different components handling network traffic, business logic, database queries, etc.  In that case, if the system is slow, it's the system that's slow, so before you fire up the profiler, you need to know where to point it.\n\nAt first glance, the general way you approach this problem is to start a timer when an event brings the system into action (e.g., a browser sends a request to your web site), stop the timer when the system produces the appropriate response (e.g., packets are sent back to the browser), then look at how much time was taken in the various parts of the system.  The problem is that in many cases, this is the wrong way to think about things.\n\nSteve Souders has done a great job of demonstrating one aspect of this idea as it applies to web sites, describing in various forms (book, article, video) how he derived what he calls the Performance Golden Rule:\nOnly 10-20% of the end user response time is spent downloading the HTML document.  The other 80-90% is spent downloading all the components in the page.His approach takes the view that you start the timer when the initial request for an HTML page comes in, but you don't stop it until everything on the page has been rendered in the browser.  From a user's point of view, this is much more reasonable.  After all, until the page has been displayed, he or she is still waiting, even if the web site itself thinks the job was finished long ago.\n\nOne of the most interesting implications of this observation is that a critical part of the user's perception of the system's performance is determined by software (in this case, the browser) over which "the system" has no control.  For example, a big part of how fast a site like Yahoo (where Souders worked when he wrote High Performance Web Sites;  he's at Google now) seems to be is determined by the user's browser, and of course Yahoo has no control over which browser the user has chosen to use.  The idea that the performance of a system is influenced by software over which it has no control generalizes.  Even native applications, for example, are typically at some degree of mercy with respect to the libraries they link with and the operating system they run on.\n\nBut that's an issue for another day.  What I want to pose now is the idea that when determining the latency of an interactive system, the timer should not be started when something triggers the system, it should be triggered when the person using that system decides that they want to do something.  Once you've decided you want to do something, everything between then and when you actually get it done is wait time, even if during that time you're typing in commands or pulling down menus or wading through search results, etc.  One of the nice things about thinking about things this way is that it offers a framework for thinking about such disparate performance issues as UI design (minimize the time needed to get from deciding what you want to do and expressing it) and prefetching and speculative execution (both of which entail satisfying requests that have not yet been expressed).\n\nScott\n\n\nAfter a year-long digression to work on C++0x, I'm finally able to get back to Fastware!, and on May 22 (a week from Saturday), I expect to have something to show for it.  I'll be giving a talk at Portland Code Camp, in Portland, Oregon.   The topic will be CPU Caches and Why You Care, and the material will be primarily taken from the Fastware! chapter on hardware, although I also plan to touch on the impact of cache considerations on algorithm and data structure design.\n\nLike all Code Camps, Portland Code Camp is free, so if you live near Portland, Oregon, and don't mind devoting a Saturday to all things code-related, I encourage you to register, then come by my session for a crash course in CPU caches.  It should be interesting to see how it goes, given that the talk currently exists only in my head.  But in my head, it's really good :-)\n\nScott\n\n	The Fastware Project	http://fastwareproject.blogspot.co.il/2010/05/thought-about-minimizing-system-latency.html	Article	3

45	2012-10-02 12:46:00	Musings: Design and Computation	I have a personal theory that the fundamental source of bugs in most software is the impedance mismatch between the notion of design and computation. We as software engineers are torn pulled in usually two seemingly different dimensions -- that of elegance in design (of systems, of interfaces, and of architectures) and that of computational efficiency (in implementations, algorithms, and practical realities of the computers we deal with). There's been countless books written about design: you have the design patterns movement which paints the world in terms of structure and interaction between objects, pattern languages dealing with different families of systems, etc. I know of a few books written about the practice of algorithmic problem solving: generic programming books, functional programming books, "Elements of Programming", and Knuth's The Art of Computer Programming. Focusing on either usually leads to gaps in a complete understanding of the problem space and therefore the result is badly designed and implemented solutions. Is it something we can do anything about? This post is my attempt at exploring the intuition that says "we can marry these two modes of thinking if only the tools we use allow it".Before anything else, let me further qualify my personal theory by elaborating a little more than a single sentence.There are two modes of thinking when solving problems using a computer program: design and computation. When in the design mode of thinking, we think about structure and organization of code, of interactions and relationships, and data flow. When in the computation mode of thinking, we think about mutation, transformation, state, transition, invariants, side-effects, and order. When in one mode we're blind from another, yet when we switch modes we influence the solutions in either.When reading patterns and pattern language books I notice that the writers usually take a structural form of code and address different forces like extensibility, isolation, encapsulation, and polymorphism. It's heavily reliant on fixed interfaces and uses interfaces to convey relationships almost exclusively as opposed to invariants. Because invariants are only implicitly (or externally) conveyed in the interface, they aren't subject to the same rigor as when in the algorithmic frame of mind -- invariants, complexity, and side-effects aren't as obvious when thinking about design.On the other hand when I'm reading algorithmic books like "Elements of Programming" and "The Art of Computer Programming" it seems that design is an artifact as opposed to the goal or even "the subject". It's hard to reconcile the design-based mode of thinking when algorithms are meant to operate in a hermetic fashion -- you have inputs, transitions, mappings, iterations, and traversals of data structures producing output. Most of these books read like an exercise in mathematics and it just so happens the programming language being used to implement the solutions require structured code to come up with the solution. Sometimes though the notion of a mathematical function is lost when things like mutation and state come in, and only because there are very few programming languages where math can be properly encoded efficiently to implement algorithms (Haskell comes to mind, but there's still the reality of state and I/O which requires Monads that remarkably not very "math-like").I see a few ways of attacking this impedance mismatch and I'll just throw these out there.Design is Computation. There aren't a lot of programming languages that allow this -- Lisp has a macro system that allows programmers to treat code as data, and since code is an embodiment of design then design and computation come hand-in hand. However if you've seen any serious Lisp system where macros are used to great effect, you will see that there are intermingled masses of design and computation in pockets of domains all being glued together by the syntax tree. There's probably a reason why Lisp hasn't been dominant even with the great power that it affords programmers that use it.Computation is Design. There are languages where the only way you do any meaningful computation is with design. Languages like Ruby encourage and support writing domain specific languages where you use composition and design to organize and effectively perform computation. Another language that allows this is Java, where the only meaningful way of doing any sort of computation is by designing your solutions into classes and functions. OOP languages encourage computation by design more than other languages.There is only solutions. Languages that allow writing solutions and providing features for implementing these solutions do not tend to weigh to either side of the continuum. This is where I think C++ is capable of excelling where you get design as a means of organizing computations. This I think is the "sweet spot" but it's lacking in enabling the previous two modes of thinking.There are valuable lessons to be learnt from the first two points. In the "design is computation" mode of thinking, being able to perform calculations based on properties of the computation is very powerful -- making decisions based on the structure of the code as opposed to just inputs and outputs yields far superior automated ways of "yielding" design. More to the first point, being able to assert certain expectations on design as a computation is a very important tool for enforcing invariants and expectations on design. This enables solving one of the issues with the design-only mindset.In the "computation is design" mode of thinking, enabling thoughtful and rigorous computation through composition is a hallmark of scalable (and re-usable) design. It's no secret that C++ has already been home to multiple domain specific languages but the key to this is being able to perform the computation only as a by-product of design but in the process of design. Generative programming relies on being able to use the design of programs and performing computations on the design to yield new types and therefore new behavior. Extracting the generative parts of DSEL building is already being done by Boost.Proto but only to the extent that it only has partial information available compared to the compiler -- one approach used by Haskell is to allow defining extensions and optimizations in the language itself, dealing with certain constructs to enable transformations that make sense in a given context.In the world of "there is only solutions" we're currently in the middle -- C++ has been a very wide programming language offering both OOP techniques and to some extent some functional programming techniques. With C++11 we've expanded the functional programming aspect with lambdas. We have more facilities for generic programming in auto and decltype. Templates got more love with variadic templates. Template functions got the capability of defaulted template parameters enabling better use of SFINAE techniques.So are we stuck with trying to reconcile these two modes of thinking? I don't think so and there are a few anecdotes that points to the attempts at reconciling them though attacking this from two different directions.First off, there are a number of attempts at making computation at compile-time more powerful than with the current state of constexpr. There's ongoing exploration of the possibilities for expanding the scope of what can be done in this space is really exciting as it widens the potential of being able to do something like Lisp macros at compile-time for generative programming. Even though we have some of these techniques implemented as template metaprograms, some other techniques we can't just achieve just yet with just template metaprogramming.Secondly, this ties in really well with being able to write C++ that works on types for real generative programming. This thought process is just in the beginning stages for me and I've a number of ideas on how I think introspection and reflection will allow more generative programming techniques. I'm still at the phase though of trying out a few forms which are consistent with "normal C++" and I'm nowhere near ready to show any of these preliminary attempts. Maybe further down the line I'll be able to share more with a wider audience.Lastly there are a number of other ways to achieve the result of married design and computation. I'll explore those in upcoming articles as I look deeper at what it means to do design-driven development and computation-driven development with C++. In the end I would hope to construct a middle-ground to get both design and computation at a good mix to leverage the power of C++ from both sides.Discussion on the topic is most welcome, please feel free to comment below.

53	2012-03-06 14:08:00	Post-Kona Mailing and More Libraries	Beach, laptop, flip-flops, and C++. Kona, Hawai'i.It took a while for me to get to writing up my experiences on the first ever ISO C++ Committee meeting that I attended in Kona, Hawai'i. There are around 70 attendees and I'm one of the few first timers to the meeting. What happens when you get a group of C++ developers, implementers, and language lawyers in the same venue for 5 days to talk about C++? Lots of fun and generally productive discussions. There's a lot of new things to look forward to in the upcoming versions of the C++ standard. Here's a high-level overview of what transpired in Kona and what I personally think would be nice to see in the next version(s) of C++.I mention versions because the committee has decided that we'll be working on getting a short-term update to the standard tentatively shooting for 2017 (C++1y or C++17) and a long-term update aiming for 2022 (C++22). The Evolution Working Group (EWG), the working group whose focus is in the addition of new features, was where the Rich Pointers (N3340) paper was discussed. I spent a lot of my time attending the EWG meetings hearing about what the potential focus for C++17 and C++22 may be.There's a lot of discussions but the big-ticket items I've listed down below:Static If -- a means of simpler compile-time programming with a more natural and familiar syntax. One motivating factor and use-case is a replacement for SFINAE tricks with templates.Concepts (better known as Constrained Templates) -- a means of enforcing syntactic and more importantly semantic requirements for types in templates. There's a lot of synergy and potential for integration of the work between the proponents of Static If and Constrained Templates so it would be nice to see great minds get together in finally making this happen in C++.Modules -- not dynamic libraries (although those would be nice to have too) but more on logical grouping of symbols for replacing header files and #include. There are two different proposals on Modules for C++ and there's a Study Group formed to address this particular issue. This looks to be one of the things that might&nbsp;be making it into C++17.Software Transactional Memory -- an update on the state of the art and progress makes it very encouraging. It's very exciting technology that potentially makes a lot of concurrency problems more manageable going forward. With hardware assistance apparently coming soon (this year or early next year from the major vendors) this proves to be something worth keeping an eye and an ear on.Reflection -- this is where Rich Pointers fall under along with a proposal for static reflection. The general feedback is that a more holistic view of reflection be taken and a more thorough presentation on the matter would be appreciated in upcoming meetings.These things are still in the proposal presentation stage where interest is gauged and potential enhancements and issues are explored. The upcoming meetings will see more fleshed out proposals and potentially more in-depth discussion of the details once the committee decides on the one big thing to include in C++17 and what two other big things to try to get into C++22.In other potentially more important news, the C++ committee has issued a Call for Papers for more libraries to bring into the standard library specification. Here's a quote from the announcement:The C++ standards committee is soliciting proposals for additional library components. Such proposals can range from small (addition of a single signature to an existing library) to large (something bigger than any current standard library component).&nbsp;In a change from past practice, the committee is processing multiple library work items in parallel, and any resulting domain specific technical reports will ship when ready rather than waiting for completion of single large technical report.&nbsp;This call for proposals in open ended; there is no cutoff date. As a practical matter, the committee is early in the post-C++11 revision cycle, and so the next year is a particularly good window of opportunity for library proposals.&nbsp;The committee welcomes proposals with or without formal standard wording (often known as "standardese"). This is a change from past practice, and is intended to encourage library developers to step forward with proposals.The motivating factor here is to dramatically increase the number of libraries that come with a C++ implementation. The committee is favoring library proposals that already intend to standardize existing practice. This means we might be able to see ICU's features made part of the C++ standard with a different (more consistent with the current standard library style) interface. We might also see Boost.Asio's interface and specification as something that comes standard to standards-compliant C++ implementations.In a similar vein I'm going to also be working with the Networking Study Group (SG4) that will focus on getting a Technical Report (TR) out that focuses on networking libraries. The hope is that we can cover various layers of the networking stack represented well in the C++ standard.There are now 4 study groups, and SD-3 details what these are and what the Study Groups mean to achieve. Here's the list copied verbatim from the mailing:WG21 currently has four SGs and appointed chairs.&nbsp;SG1: Concurrency and Parallelism (Hans Boehm)SG2: Modules (Doug Gregor)SG3: File System (Beman Dawes)SG4: Networking (Kyle Kloepper)&nbsp;An SG is not a formal project, and so ISO does not formally appoint an Editor.&nbsp;However, some SGs will be working on a document, and those SGs should havesomeone who acts as editor to maintain the working draft of that document, and&nbsp;publish each draft revision as an N-numbered paper. The SG can approve changes&nbsp;to its own working draft, but the understanding is that the final product will&nbsp;be a submission to a full WG21 meeting for further processing.The Library Working Group (LWG) is working on multiple concurrent efforts to publish logically-grouped TRs that focus on a distinct areas. The idea is that these TRs can be published when they're ready independent of whether or how the C++17 effort is going. Of course changes to the working draft may affect the interfaces of the libraries being defined in the TRs, the agreement has been largely that any new features that go into C++17 will be incremental and non-intrusive to C++11, which means the LWG can focus on TRs that use C++11 as the core language in the libraries specified in the TR.Call to ActionSo this post is not just about a report, this is also a call to action. Let us (the C++ committee members) know what libraries you'd like to see in every C++ implementation, what's lacking, and what you want us to address in the standard library and the language. It was mentioned several times in the meetings that the committee needs more user feedback and representation from actual users, not just the experts. We'd like to hear what people think should be the direction of C++ and how we can make lives of users easier in terms of libraries and actual language features.Thanks very much and I do hope this update helps.\r\n             \r\n	Cpp Soup	http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/CppSoup/~3/j4uVDj9wiik/post-kona-mailing-and-more-libraries.html	Article	3
62	2011-07-05 13:18:00	What You've Missed With C++: 2011 So Far	The past few months have been a jam-packed with a few developments in terms of C++. Not only did C++0x get the almost unanimous nod of the industry to be good enough to be called C++11 but there's also a few stories that have come out that need some attention too. There was the Google findings which show that C++ is by far the best performing programming language (if you have enough programmers that know the language well enough to wield it proficiently) and C++ AMP which aims to bring massively parallel C++ programming closer to the mainstream by Microsoft. Also, last May BoostCon 2011 was held with a pretty good lineup of talks that Boost users would be most appreciative of. It seems like 2011 is the year that C++ dusts off its boots and starts marching on again to the top of the programming language hill. Or is it?For a programming language that started in the 80's and is still being used by and large successfully by the tech companies that matter (I'm talking Microsoft, Google, Apple, Adobe, Facebook) you'd think C++ would enjoy a revered spot in the programming language hierarchy. Unfortunately if you look around and ask programmers what they think about C++ more or less you're going to find people who will have a number of bad things to say about it. Why does a programming language so hated be so effective and still be in use in industry?First of all I think it all comes from a fundamental fact that good programmers develop good solutions. If you put a good tool (in this case a programming language) in the hands of a good craftsman (in this case a programmer) then the task you're set to accomplish would be accomplished with good enough results. You can still get a good outcome if you have bad tools and a great craftsman or if you have great tools and a bad craftsman. But the best results come from good tools in the hands of great craftsmen. Cathedrals, airplanes, ships, bridges, and all the infrastructure that last are built by craftsmen that had access to the best tools they had at the time they were built. I would argue that the software that stands the test of time (those running in Google or Facebook's servers, Microsoft's software, Adobe's software, Apple's products) are those written by great craftsmen regardless with good tools.Second reason I can think of is the flexibility of the programming language. There are not a lot of programming languages where you can use it to write device drivers, operating systems, web application systems, realtime monitoring systems, embedded software, desktop applications, imaging applications, and even mobile applications by basing on just a single standard. There's a good reason why the flexible "general purpose" programming languages enjoy the most usage among the craftsmen that know their craft. It just so happens that C++ has enough flexibility to allow pretty much anything to be done with it with features that support the development of easily scalable software -- and I mean scale as in the capacity to grow the software as far as complexity and design is concerned. With a limited programming language that wasn't focused on "usability" in its current version (C++03) it's managed to be one of the most effective tools used by a lot of programmers in industry. Now with most of the shortcomings addressed in the upcoming version of the language, the flexible programming language just got a lot more flexible and usable.The last thing that I think makes C++ a very compelling programming language to use today and going forward is: for any interesting problem to be solved at scale, you're going to need a programming language that gives you performance, flexibility, and scalability without sacrificing any of these three. I have yet to come across a programming language that comes near the performance profile of C++, supports as many programming paradigms that C++ does, and allows software construction and design to scale favorably as much as C++ does. There are some interesting programming languages that have come out recently but I have still yet to see one that actually can seriously replace C++ as the programming language for "serious software".The reason C++ is still significant today is because the problems worth solving require as much of the machine as possible while being efficient in doing so. Sure you can use any programming language to write a web application, but if you're trying to handle billions of queries per minute and would want to get the most out of the machines you have at your disposal you're going to use one that allows you to scale your development effort and your application without sacrificing performance. The problems that are worth solving now require massive amounts of computing power and it's actually an advantage to have your application as efficient as you can make it. This is where C++ as a programming language shines.With C++ in the hands of experienced and good craftsmen, solutions to problems worth solving are efficient, scalable, and maintainable. With a new version coming up I'd say this decade is the one where C++ is more relevant than ever.\r\n             \r\n	Cpp Soup	http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/CppSoup/~3/VfguFqnoIJI/what-you-missed-with-c-2011-so-far.html	Article	3
70	2015-11-08 00:00:00	CppCon'15 and Silicon Valley Code Camp Presentations	\n\n\n\nIn last couple of months I did a couple of presentations about my recent projects in C++. Session videos, slides, and code for all the presentations are now available online. Both projects have functional programming at their heart. I've found exploring functional programming in modern C++ quite a fun ride. Without further ado, here's the content\n\nCppCon'15: Reactive Stream Processing in Industrial IoT using DDS and RxCpp\n\n\n\n\n\nTopic: 50 billion devices will be connected to the Internet by 2020. Many of them will belong to national critical infrastructure (smart power grids, smart roads, smart hospitals, smart cities) – forming the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). These devices will generate data streams that will need to be correlated, merged, filtered, and analyzed in real-time at the edge. This talk will explore an elegant solution to this problem that is productive, composable, concurrency-friendly, and scales well. We utilize OMG’s Data Distribution Service for Real-Time Systems (DDS) standard for connectivity, and Reactive Extensions (Rx) for functional-style composable asynchronous data processing in modern C++.\n\nRx is a generalization of futures and can be thought of as the async equivalent of C++ ranges. It helps create asynchronous data processing pipelines by chaining reusable higher-order functions (map, filter, flatmap, zip etc.) that rely on a common abstraction called an Observable (a continuation monad). RxCpp makes wonderful use of functional programming features in modern C++ including generic lambdas, type inference, variadic templates, and more. Rx is one of the best libraries that truly highlights the power of functional design principles applied in a (primarily) object-oriented programming languages.\n\nDDS and Rx work great together because they are both reactive, use the publish-subscribe paradigm, and facilitate loose coupling between components. This presentation will discuss Rx4DDS, which is a research library that integrates Rx with RTI Connext DDS. Rx4DDS enables a clean, distributed, asynchronous dataflow architecture for stream processing and is available in C#, C++, and JavaScript.\n\nSlides\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Reactive Stream Processing in Industrial IoT using DDS and Rx  from Sumant Tambe \n\n\nMore reading\n\n\nData-Centric Stream Processing in the Fog is an RTI blog post with detailed description of one of the demonstrations and code I showed at CppCon'15. If you know what I mean by "The finalization actions are baked into each data pipeline at the time of creation" you can skip right ahead.\n\nRx4DDS home page includes all the demonstrations and code I showed at CppCon. The description is somewhat sparse and assumes that you have seen the earlier resources listed here.\n\n\n\n\nSilicon Valley Code Camp: Composable Generators and Property-based Testing in C++14  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopic: C++14 has an enviable collection of functional programming features such as generic lambdas, type inference, variadic templates, function types with co-/contra-variance and so on. With mature compiler support, designing and implementing performant functional-style libraries has become very pleasant in modern C++. Tools and techniques (e.g., property-based testing) enjoyed by the programmers in only elite functional languages (Haskell, Scala) now appear to be within C++'s reach.\n\nThis presentation will discuss two classic techniques from the functional domain -- composable data generators and property-based testing -- implemented in C++14 for testing a generic serialization and deserialization library (RefleX). We will look at techniques of constructing complex generators using a random number generator and a tolerable dose of monoids, functors, and of course, monads. We won't stop there though! We will look at automatic type generators using C++ TMP. Equipped with data and type generators, we'll take property-based testing to a whole new level where lazy programmers don't have to do anything to test their programs beyond just compilation and running the test over and over.\n\nCode on github: generators\n\nSlides \n\n\n  \n\n\n C++ Generators and Property-based Testing  from Sumant Tambe \n\n\n\n\n\nBonus Content: Channel9 Interview at CppCon'15\n\n\n\nHere's my really short interview recorded at CppCon'15 by Channel9.

(A potential conference appearance has been in the works for a while. If it gets scheduled, I'll let you know.)\n\n\n\n\nWell, it's been scheduled, and I'm letting you know: I'll be giving a presentation at the Nexon Developers Conference in Seoul on April 28. The topic is "Modern C++ Beyond the Headlines," and I plan to talk about how some features in C++11/14 are better than they appear at first glance (e.g., constexpr), while others are likely to be less attractive than they initially seem (e.g., emplacement).\n\n\n\nThere are no talks in the pipeline after this one, and I've been holding fast on my decision not to accept new engagements, so in all likelihood, this is the last C++ presentation I'll make. If you want to be there to see if I botch the landing, the Nexon Developers Conference at the end of the month is the place to be!\n\n\n\nScott\n\n\n	The View From Aristeia	http://scottmeyers.blogspot.co.il/2016/04/presentation-at-nexon-developers.html	Article	3
98	2015-09-07 00:00:00	Thoughts on the Vagaries of C++ Initialization	\n\n\nIf I want to define a local int variable, there are four ways to do it:\nint x1 = 0;\nint x2(0);\nint x3 = {0};\nint x4{0};\n\nEach syntactic form has an official name:\nint x1 = 0;              // copy initialization\nint x2(0);               // direct initialization\nint x3 = {0};            // copy list initialization\nint x4{0};               // direct list initialization\n\nDon't be misled by the word "copy" in the official nomenclature. Copy forms might perform moves (for types more complicated than int), and in practice, implementations often elide both copy and move operations in initializations using the "copy" syntactic forms.\n\n(If you engage in written communication with a language lawyer about these matters and said lawyer has its pedantic bit set, you'll be reprimanded for hyphen elision. I speak from experience. The official terms are "copy-initialization," "direct-initialization," "copy-list-initialization," and "direct-list-initialization." When dealing with language lawyers in pedantic mode, it's wise to don a hazmat suit or to switch to oral communication.)\n\nBut my interest here isn't terminology, it's language design.\n\nQuestion #1: Is it good language design to have four ways to say the same thing?\n\nLet's suppose that instead of wanting to define an int, we want to define a std::atomic. std::atomics don't support copy initialization (the copy constructor is deleted), so that syntactic form becomes invalid. Copy list initialization continues to succeed, however, because for std::atomic, it's treated more or less like direct initialization, which remains acceptable. So:\n\nstd::atomic x5 = 0;    // error!\nstd::atomic x6(0);     // fine\nstd::atomic x7 = {0};  // fine\nstd::atomic x8{0};     // fine\n\n(I frankly expected copy list initialization to be treated like copy initialization, but GCC and Clang thought otherwise, and 13.3.1.7 [over.match.list] in C++14 backs them up. Live and learn.)\n\nQuestion #2: Is it good language design to have one of the four syntaxes for defining an int be invalid for defining a std::atomic?\n\nNow let's suppose we prefer to use auto for our variable instead of specifying the type explicitly. All four initialization syntaxes compile, but two yield std::initializer_list variables instead of ints:\nauto x9 = 0;                // x9's type is int\nauto x10(0);                // x10's type is int\nauto x11 = {0};             // x11's type is std::initializer_list\nauto x12{0};                // x12's type is std::initializer_list\n\nThis would be the logical place for me to pose a third question, namely, whether these type deductions represent good language design. The question is moot; it's widely agreed that they don't. Since C++11's introduction of auto variables and "uniform" braced initialization syntax, it's been a common error for people to accidentally define a std::initializer_list when they meant to define, e.g., an int.\n\nThe Standardization Committee acknowledged the problem by adopting N3922 into draft C++17. N3922 specifies that an auto variable, when coupled with direct list initialization syntax and exactly one value inside the braces, no longer yields a std::initializer_list. Instead, it does what essentially every programmer originally expected it to do: define a variable with the type of the value inside the braces. However, N3922 leaves the auto type deduction rules unchanged when copy list initialization is used. Hence, under N3922:\nauto x9 = 0;                // x9's type is int\nauto x10(0);                // x10's type is int\nauto x11 = {0};             // x11's type is std::initializer_list\nauto x12{0};                // x12's type is int\n\nSeveral compilers have implemented N3922. In fact, it can be hard—maybe even impossible— to get such compilers to adhere to the C++14 standard, even if you want them to. GCC 5.1 follows the N3922 rule even when expressly in C++11 or C++14 modes, i.e., when compiled with -std=c++11 or -std=c++14. Visual C++ 2015 is similar: type deduction is performed in accord with N3922, even when /Za ("disable language extensions") is used.\n\n Question #3: Is it good language design for copy list initialization (i.e., braces plus "=") to be treated differently from direct list initialization (i.e., braces without "=") when deducing the type of auto variables?\n\nNote that these questions are not about why C++ has the rules it has. They're about whether the rules represent good programming language design. If we were designing C++ from scratch, would we come up with the following?\nint x1 = 0;                 // fine\nint x2(0);                  // fine\nint x3 = {0};               // fine\nint x4{0};                  // fine\n\nstd::atomic x5 = 0;    // error!\nstd::atomic x6(0);     // fine\nstd::atomic x7 = {0};  // fine\nstd::atomic x8{0};     // fine\n\nauto x9 = 0;                // x9's type is int\nauto x10(0);                // x10's type is int\nauto x11 = {0};             // x11's type is std::initializer_list\nauto x12{0};                // x12's type is int\n\nHere's my view:\n\nQuestion #1: Having four ways to say one thing constitutes bad design. I understand why C++ is the way it is (primarily backward-compatibility considerations with respect to C or  C++98), but four ways to express one idea leads to confusion and, as we've seen, inconsistency.\nQuestion #2: Removing copy initialization from the valid initialization syntaxes makes things worse, because it introduces a seemingly gratuitous inconsistency between ints and std::atomics. \nNon-question #3: I thought the C++11 rule about deducing std::initializer_lists from braced initializers was crazy from the day I learned about it. The more times I got bitten by it in practice, the crazier I thought it was. I have a lot of bite marks.\nQuestion #3: N3922 takes the craziness of C++11 and escalates it to insanity by eliminating only one of two syntaxes that nearly always flummox developers. It thus replaces one source of programmer confusion (auto + braces yields counterintuitive type deduction) with an even more confusing source (auto + braces sometimes yields counterintuitive type dedeuction). One of my earlier blog posts referred to N2640, where deducing a std::initializer_list for auto variables was deemed "desirable," but no explanation was offered as to why it's desirable. I think that much would be gained and little would be lost by abandoning the special treatment of braced initializers for auto variables. For example, doing that would reduce the number of sets of type deduction rules in C++ from five to four. \n\nBut maybe it's just me. What do you think about the vagaries of C++ initialization?\n\nScott\n\n	The View From Aristeia	http://scottmeyers.blogspot.co.il/2015/09/thoughts-on-vagaries-of-c-initialization.html	Article	3
105	2015-07-08 00:00:00	EMC++ Outtake: __PRETTY_FUNCTION__ and __FUNCSIG__	\n\n\n\nItem 4 of Effective Modern C++ is "Know how to view deduced types." It's part of Chapter 1 ("Deducing Types"), which is available for free download here. In the draft of that Item published in July 2014, I discussed how the compiler-dependent constructs __PRETTY_FUNCTION__ and __FUNCSIG__ could be used to produce printable representations of types deduced for and used in template functions. By the time I published the next draft of the Item about six weeks later, __PRETTY_FUNCTION__ and __FUNCSIG__ had disappeared. In a comment on my blog post announcing the existence of the new draft, Benoit M wrote:\n\nI noticed that the paragraph named “beyond typeid” has disappeared in \nthis version. It was about __PRETTY_FUNCTION__, __FUNCSIG__ and other \nimplementation-specific ways to know the types of the variables \ninvolved.\n\nI thought it was very interesting. I suppose that you \nremoved it because it was not about C++11 or C++14 new language \nfeatures, so it is out of scope for a book called “… Modern C++”, and \nalso because compiler extra features are by essence not portable and \ncould even be removed in the future, so it could be a bad habit to rely \non those.\n\nNevertheless I would appreciate if you restored that subsection, at least in a footnote.\nI replied:\n\nI decided that Boost.TypeIndex was a preferable thing to mention, \nbecause it has the same interface across multiple platforms. The \ninformation I used to have on __PRETTY_FUNCTION__, etc., won't go back \nin the book, but I might publish it online as a blog entry.\n\nI filed the idea away for a time when work on the book was mostly behind me. Nearly a year later, that time has finally come.\n\n\n\n\nMy original plan was to take the information on __PRETTY_FUNCTION__, etc., from the July 2014 draft and turn it into a blog post, but I now think it makes more sense to simply republish the Item 4 draft that existed at that time. That way you can see the discussion of  __PRETTY_FUNCTION__ and __FUNCSIG__in context, and if you're really bored, you can also compare the initial published draft of Item 4 with the version that appears in the book. The July 2014 draft of Item 4 is available HERE.\n\nEither way, I hope you find the information on __PRETTY_FUNCTION__ and __FUNCSIG__interesting.\n\nScott \n\n	The View From Aristeia	http://scottmeyers.blogspot.co.il/2015/07/emc-outtake-prettyfunction-and-funcsig.html	Article	3
114	2010-04-12 00:00:00	System error support in C++0x - part 4	\n[ part 1, part 2, part 3 ]Creating your own error codesAs I stated in part 1, one of the principles behind the  facility is user-extensibility. This means that you can use the mechanism just described to define your own error codes.In this section, I'll outline what you need to do. As a basis for a worked example, I will assume you're writing an HTTP library and need errors that correspond to the HTTP response codes.Step 1: define the error valuesYou first need to define the set of error values. If you're using C++0x, you can use an enum class, similar to std::errc:enum class http_error{  continue_request = 100,  switching_protocols = 101,  ok = 200,  ...  gateway_timeout = 504,  version_not_supported = 505};The errors are assigned values according to the HTTP response codes. The importance of this will become obvious when it comes to using the error codes. Whatever values you choose, errors should have non-zero values. As you may recall, the  facility uses a convention where zero means success.You can use regular (that is, C++03-compatible) enums by dropping the class keyword:enum http_error{  ...};Note: C++0x's enum class differs from enum in that the former encloses enumerator names in the class scope. To access an enumerator you must prefix the class name, as in http_error::ok. You can approximate this behaviour by wrapping the plain enum in a namespace:namespace http_error{  enum http_error_t  {    ...  };}For the remainder of this example I will assume the use of enum class. Applying the namespace-wrapping approach is left as an exercise for the reader.Step 2: define an error_category classAn error_code object consists of both an error value and a category. The error category determines whether a value of 100 means http_error::continue_request, std::errc::network_down (ENETDOWN on Linux), or something else entirely.To create a new category, you must derive a class from error_category:class http_category_impl  : public std::error_category{public:  virtual const char* name() const;  virtual std::string message(int ev) const;};For the moment, this class will implement only error_category's pure virtual functions.Step 3: give the category a human-readable nameThe error_category::name() virtual function must return a string identifying the category:const char* http_category_impl::name() const{  return "http";}This name does not need to be universally unique, as it is really only used when writing an error code to a std::ostream. However, it would certainly be desirable to make it unique within a given program.Step 4: convert error codes to stringsThe error_category::message() function converts an error value into a string that describes the error:std::string http_category_impl::message(int ev) const{  switch (ev)  {  case http_error::continue_request:    return "Continue";  case http_error::switching_protocols:    return "Switching protocols";  case http_error::ok:    return "OK";  ...  case http_error::gateway_timeout:    return "Gateway time-out";  case http_error::version_not_supported:    return "HTTP version not supported";  default:    return "Unknown HTTP error";  }}When you call the error_code::message() member function, the error_code in turn calls the above virtual function to obtain the error message.It's important to remember that these error messages must stand alone; they may be written (to a log file, say) at a point in the program when no additional context is available. If you are wrapping an existing API that uses error messages with "inserts", you'll have to create your own messages. For example, if an HTTP API uses the message string "HTTP version %d.%d not supported", the equivalent stand-alone message would be "HTTP version not supported".The  facility provides no assistance when it comes to localisation of these messages. It is likely that the messages emitted by your standard library's error categories will be based on the current locale. If localisation is a requirement in your program, I recommend using the same approach. (Some history: The LWG was aware of the need for localisation, but there was no design before the group that satisfactorily reconciled localisation with user-extensibility. Rather than engage in some design-by-committee, the LWG opted to say nothing in the standard about localisation of the error messages.)Step 5: uniquely identify the categoryThe identity of an error_category-derived object is determined by its address. This means that when you write:const std::error_category& cat1 = ...;const std::error_category& cat2 = ...;if (cat1 == cat2)  ...the if condition is evaluated as if you had written:if (&cat1 == &cat2)  ...Following the example set by the standard library, you should provide a function to return a reference to a category object:const std::error_category& http_category();This function must always return a reference to the same object. One way to do that is to define a global object in a source file and return a reference to that:http_category_impl http_category_instance;const std::error_category& http_category(){  return http_category_instance;}However, using a global does introduce issues to do with order of initialisation across modules. An alternative approach is to use a locally scoped static variable:const std::error_category& http_category(){  static http_category_impl instance;  return instance;}In this case, the category object is initialised on first use. C++0x also guarantees that the initialisation is thread-safe. (C++03 makes no such guarantee.)History: In the early design stages, we considered using an integer or string to identify an error_code's category. The main issue with that approach was ensuring uniqueness in conjunction with user extensibility. If a category was identified by integer or string, what was to stop collisions between two unrelated libraries? Using object identity leverages the linker in preventing different categories from having the same identity. Furthermore, storing a pointer to a base class allows us to make error_codes polymorphic while keeping them as copyable value types.Step 6: construct an error_code from the enumAs I showed in part 3, the  implementation requires a function called make_error_code() to associate an error value with a category. For the HTTP errors, you would write this function as follows:std::error_code make_error_code(http_error e){  return std::error_code(      static_cast(e),      http_category());}For completeness, you should also provide the equivalent function for construction of an error_condition:std::error_condition make_error_condition(http_error e){  return std::error_condition(      static_cast(e),      http_category());}Since the  implementation finds these functions using argument-dependent lookup, you should put them in the same namespace as the http_error type.Step 7: register for implicit conversion to error_codeFor the http_error enumerators to be usable as error_code constants, enable the conversion constructor using the is_error_code_enum type trait:namespace std{  template   struct is_error_code_enum    : public true_type {};}Step 8 (optional): assign default error conditionsSome of the errors you define may have a similar meaning to the standard's errc error conditions. For example, the HTTP response code 403 Forbidden means basically the same thing as std::errc::permission_denied.The error_category::default_error_condition() virtual function lets you define an error_condition that is equivalent to a given error code. (See part 2 for the definition of equivalence.) For the HTTP errors, you can write:class http_category_impl  : std::error_category{public:  ...  virtual std::error_condition    default_error_condition(int ev) const;};...std::error_condition  http_category_impl::default_error_condition(    int ev) const{  switch (ev)  {  case http_error::forbidden:    return std::errc::permission_denied;  default:    return std::error_condition(ev, *this);  }}If you choose not to override this virtual function, an error_code's default error_condition is one with the same error value and category. This is the behaviour of the default: case shown above.Using the error codesYou can now use the http_error enumerators as error_code constants, both when setting an error:void server_side_http_handler(    ...,    std::error_code& ec){  ...  ec = http_error::ok;}and when testing for one:std::error_code ec;load_resource("http://some/url", ec);if (ec == http_error::ok)  ...Since the error values are based on the HTTP response codes, we can also set an error_code directly from the response:std::string load_resource(    const std::string& url,    std::error_code& ec){  // send request ...  // receive response ...  int response_code;  parse_response(..., &response_code);  ec.assign(response_code, http_category());  // ...}You can also use this technique when wrapping the errors produced by an existing library.Finally, if you defined an equivalence relationship in step 8, you can write:std::error_code ec;data = load_resource("http://some/url", ec);if (ec == std::errc::permission_denied)  ...without needing to know the exact source of the error condition. As explained in part 2, the original error code (e.g. http_error::forbidden) is retained so that no information is lost.In the next part, I'll show how to create and use custom error_conditions.\n\n	Thinking Asynchronously in C++	http://blog.think-async.com/2010/04/system-error-support-in-c0x-part-4.html	Article	3

46	2012-09-28 16:00:00	Rich Pointers (Update) and Reflection	The Portland meeting is just a few weeks away and even though I'm not going I along with my co-authors have prepared an update to the rich pointers paper. It took a while for us to update the paper because contributing to the C++ standard isn't my 100% commitment at Google, but I am happy to be able to take some time to commit to updating it, as well as having my co-authors review and make changes as well. The result is a greatly simplified proposal which turns the proposed new pointer type and turns it into a library interface. The paper also gained a static metadata proposal that aims to make type introspection a first-class operation.The motivation for getting introspection into the language as a first-class entity is backed by a lot of previous and well known pain-points in three main areas:Serialization -- being able to save the state of an object as a sequence of bytes and reconstituting a new instance of the same type at some later time. This is important for all sorts of applications, one of the most compelling is distributed computing.Generative Programming -- being able to generate and compute with types to reduce repetitive code. Automating repetitive patterns like setter/getter functions and adding value semantics to types via generated proxy types at compile time are very powerful techniques.JIT and Embedded Runtimes -- allowing generation of types in embedded runtimes to be inspected and used appropriately by the hosting application. Dynamic languages have this capability because precisely of this feature (think about how "eval" and similar functions work).C++ has generally been viewed as a bare-metal power-tool for heavy duty performance-critical development, so why bring in introspection features into the language now? There's a number of reasons but better than reasons there's also experience.Personally I've had to deal with the issue of serialization at one point or another in my career. I've been happy with Boost.Serialization which I've used in production successfully. I know the power of being able to send data from one place to another via the network and being able to scale systems horizontally this way. There are countless numbers of distributed programming systems that rely on serialization. Precisely because there's no automated way to make this happen is the reason why multiple man-hours and millions of dollars worth of bugs in C++ have been wasted.One of the better solutions I've run into before and while at Google is this wonderful thing called Protocol Buffers. Protobufs have this property that you can extend the definition and still have older messages be valid and even backward compatible. It does this by having a means of associating metadata with the actual message on the C++ side, so that it can interpret messages in a consistent fashion. The idea is to use a type descriptor on the C++ implementation to be able to know how to deal with messages.The unfortunate part of protocol buffers is that messages have to be defined in a different configuration language. This means if you want to get the extensibility and performance&nbsp;that protocol buffers afford you when serializing and deserializing messages you need to define protocol buffers using a different language. The reason for this is because C++ doesn't have a way of allowing code inspect a type definition (struct or class) to figure out what the data members are. With a static reflection mechanism, we can use a struct's definition as a protocol buffer definition and generate efficient serialization/deserialization routines. With dynamic reflection we can look at objects with runtime polymorphic types and determine what to do at runtime what to do.I share a passion with my co-authors and other people who want to see C++ be a language that allows heavy-duty general programming solutions to be both powerful and awesome. We have a great facility in templates and the new C++11 features like constexpr that may enable at a later time more generative programming techniques.

54	2012-01-23 07:34:00	Rich Pointers: Frequently Asked Questions	Towards the end of last week the Pre-Kona ISO C++ Committee Mailing was released. This featured a few very important papers for the Evolution Working Group (EWG) regarding Concepts (N3351), Modules (N3347), and Static If (N3322). Rich Pointers (written by yours truly along with comments from Lawrence Crowl and Matt Austern) is N3340&nbsp;got a few questions asked from the EWG mailing list and in Google+ (as well as through emails directly to me). Even though I have responded to these questions as thoroughly as I could, I've found it prudent to post an FAQ to make the issues raised a little more exposure.Why a new pointer type? Why not just extend RTTI?If you've read through the whole paper, it doesn't do much to say why a new pointer type is being proposed as a viable solution to the different motivations for the paper (see my other post about rich pointers for background). It does mention some hints that bear repeating and pointing out:We don't want users to pay for what they don't use -- more precisely, we only want the compiler to generate the type descriptors for types that are used through rich pointers.We don't want to break existing code that rely on normal pointer semantics that's why we didn't go about changing how pointers work. Backward compatibility is important.We don't want to tack the implementation onto existing runtime type information (RTTI) for backward compatibility. There's code out there that has been built and linked to rely on std::type_info being a certain size and layout -- changing this on newer libraries/binaries will cause ABI compatibility issues that we don't want to introduce.Although the proposal does hint that it can use RTTI in cases when upgrading from a normal pointer to a rich pointer, this is only going to be true if RTTI was enabled in the compilation of the module in which the type was defined. This cannot be guaranteed and this is by design as well.Why not just a smart pointer with an assist from the compiler to generate the descriptors?This may be feasible and as the paper points out there is a way of achieving this. Unfortunately the following cannot be guaranteed by a library-only implementation:Deterministic runtime registration of types from libraries. There's currently no way to ensure that a rich_ptr will be able to contain the pointer to the correct type especially if the source is a normal pointer.Deterministic invalidation of already-registered types. There's no cross-platform and standard way for registering new types in an application's runtime that also guarantees that there's only one definition of a type, and that objects of that single type can be referred to using the correct pointer type.Clear upgrade path from one version of a type to the latest version of the type. Similar to the above point, there's no clear and cross-platform way of doing this.Automatic and selective generation of complete types and those types it depends on in its definition. Even with a compiler assist, making this happen with a normal template class and the type for this given template is far too much work for the compiler as opposed to having the compiler treat rich pointers as a special type of pointer.There are also many more reasons which involve the definition of a cross-platform runtime interface, which will definitely vary from platform to platform -- even though that part will definitely be a library, a library-implemented type cannot get too much special treatment that violates the basic rules of C++.Why use the '%' character and not another character (like '^' or '@')?There's really no strong reason to use %, but there are reasons to reject '^' and '@'. The caret character ('^') although ideal to use similar to how Pascal pointers work, unfortunately is already used by Microsoft in their proprietary C++/CLI implementation. Not chosing the caret was an obvious decision to avoid the potential clash and objections with this extension to standard C++. The at character ('@') although has been used in the Ruby programming language, isn't a special symbol (nor a valid symbol) in C++ -- making @ a valid operator character opens up potential major surgery for current compilers and the grammar. In contrast, the percent character ('%') is already a valid symbol and operator in C++ that has a binary operator counterpart -- this is symmetric with the asterisk ('*') which is both a unary and binary operator version.I personally would also like to think that the percent symbol denotes the presence of two things on different sides of the common line -- a pointer that refers to an object (top circle) and the type descriptor (bottom circle). Of course this is a mnemonic device and symbolism that's very far from existing practice and usage of the percent operator (as a modulo operator), I'd like to think I tried to give it some meaning that's relevant. ;)Is there an implementation available?Short answer: Not yet.Long answer: If the committee agrees that this is something worth exploring, I'm very much poised to go ahead and implement it as an extension to the Clang compiler front-end. At this time the proposal is meant to spark discussion as to whether it's something the members of the committee (and the users) will want to see in the language. Practically speaking, there's no point in going forward with an implementation if people don't think the original idea is worth implementing in the language anyway.ConclusionsThe Kona meeting is exactly two weeks away and I'm going to be preparing more materials for presentation among the members of the committee. I'll also be reading the other papers that are in the pre-Kona meeting to prepare for the discussions that I definitely want to be contributing to in the meetings. You can also expect that I will be writing about the meeting afterwards and will be keeping notes as the meetings go on.I'm definitely looking forward to the meeting -- if you're going, I do hope to see you there. If you're not going and would like to send your feedback on any of the papers and aren't on the committee mailing lists, please feel free to send in your comments either through the comment form or through email.Thanks for reading this far and I do hope this helps!\r\n             \r\n	Cpp Soup	http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/CppSoup/~3/xmGUyRvRHLY/rich-pointers-frequently-asked.html	Article	3
63	2011-04-18 13:19:00	cpp-netlib 0.9.0 Released!	After the one-week beta period for the 0.9.0 release, I'm happy to announce that the official 0.9.0 release is now available for general availability at the Github project downloads page. This 0.9.0 release is the first version of the library to be submitted for review to the Boost C++ Library project. Most changes that happened from the beta to the official release involve adding debugging information to critical parts of the server and client implementations as well as documentation and Boost.Build system updates.This release series will be supported until April 2012, which means all new development for the 1.0 line will happen on a different branch and will continue to contain new implementations and interface-breaking changes over the 0.9.x line. Currently the roadmap for the library is still in flux, but if you're interested in putting in feature requests you can file them through the Github project issues page. Soon enough a wiki page containing the roadmap for the 1.0 release with updated milestones will be released for public availability.Help WantedAt this time I would also like to announce that I am currently looking for help in various aspects of the project namely:\tWebsite\tDocumentation\tTesting\tDevelopmentThis is mostly due to the fact that I've just recently started work at Google Australia, and may not be able to work on the library on a full-time basis. I'll transition more into a maintainer role and will still be doing most of the development on high-impact items.New ProtocolsThe 1.0 line will get the HTTP implementation into a state of stability, which should allow other protocols to enter the library. Those that are highest on the list of priority protocols are:\tFTP\tSMTP\tXMPPThe focus for 1.0 will be to implement other protocols so that the generic parts of the implementation can be lifted. Also, better installation and integration support for users that might not like the header-only nature of the library along with better customization points for tweaking implementation details would have to be made available as well.The 1.0 line will be dealing with making the library more flexible in the facilities it uses to achieve the designs it uses. There are a number of other performance and usability points which will have to be addressed to make cpp-netlib adoption in more projects easier.The Road AheadAlong with a stability push, the goal for the cpp-netlib project is to attempt to build a community which mimics the Boost C++ Library process, with a more open development/contribution model. The C++ Network Library Project will be started officially with moves to make collaboration and further development of the code a more inviting and more open process. Once these preparations are in place, I'll be announcing what the plan for the foreseeable future of the library and the project will be like.At the moment the library is looking to adopt other projects that would be useful in the context of a modern C++ library that deals with network-related programming. In the end the goal is to ultimately allow for developing both server and client services that talk in different (and maybe custom) protocols easily with the C++ Network Library. Along with this is an attempt to get the library into Boost as well as maybe part of the Standard C++ Libraries.It's good times ahead -- I hope to be able to deliver more good news with cpp-netlib development from here down under.\r\n             \r\n	Cpp Soup	http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/CppSoup/~3/xc74JtKK_I4/cpp-netlib-090-released.html	Article	3
71	2015-06-28 00:00:00	Fun with Lambdas: C++14 Style (part 4)	\n\nThis is part 4 in the series of Fun with Lambdas: C++14 Style. The previous posts are part 3, part 2, and part 1. \n\nC++14 has a number of features that support functional-style design. By "functional-style" I mean heavy use of higher-order functions (functions that take other functions as arguments). Quite often arguments to the higher-order functions are lambdas (closures, to be precise). With automatic return type deduction for normal functions, writing higher-order function becomes very easy and seamless in C++14.\n\nThis time, I have chosen a "text-book" example to show you the power of C++14: Composable Data Generators\nWhat is a Generator?\nA Generator produces values of type T randomly. There is already a random number generator defined in the C library: random(). It produces long ints.\n\nWe can use this basic generator to create higher-level generators, such as bool, character, floating point numbers, etc. Even random sequence and structure generators are possible.\n\nBut first, lets add some structure around the C library function so that we can compose generators.\n\n#include \n\nstruct RootRandomGen\n{\n  long int operator () () const \n  {\n    return random();\n  }\n};\n\n\nRootRandomGen is a very simple function-object that when called produces a random number between 0 and RAND_MAX. \n\nLet's create a Generator template from which we can create other generators.\n\n\ntemplate \nclass Gen \n{\n    GenFunc genfunc;\n\n  public:\n    explicit Gen(GenFunc func) \n      : genfunc(std::move(func)) \n    { } \n    \n    T generate() \n    {   \n      return genfunc();\n    }   \n};\n\n\nThe Gen class template allows us to pass any function-object or closure and a make a "generator" out of it. Of course, the function must not take any arguments and must produce a value. \n\nTo simplify creation of Generators from just lambdas, we create a helper factory function. This is where the power of C++14 starts becoming apparent.\n\n\ntemplate \nauto make_gen_from(GenFunc&& func)\n{\n  return Gen(std::forward(func));\n}\n\n\nmake_gen_from is a higher-order function that takes a closure as an argument and creates a Gen object. GenFunc is the type of the closure. The type T is deduced using decltype(func()), which is C++14 syntax to say whatever the type of the return value of func is. Rest of it is perfect-forwarding of the func argument to the Gen object.\n\n\nTo create many more generators, such as for bool, char, string, etc, a function like make_gen might be quite useful. So, let's add one. \n\n\ntemplate \nauto make_gen();\n\ntemplate   \nauto make_gen()\n{\n  return make_gen_from(RootRandomGen()); \n  //return make_gen_from([]() { return random(); }); \n}\n\n\nThe long int generator simply uses the "Root" generator. Alternatively, RootRandomGen can be defined in-place using a lambda as shown above. I.e., RootRandomGen is superfluous. \n\n\nLet's test what we've so far.\n\n\n\nvoid init_random() \n{\n  time_t t;\n  time(&t);\n  srandom(t);\n}\n\nint main(void)\n{\n  init_random();\n  auto gen = make_gen();\n  std::cout < gen.generate(); // expect a random value.\n}\n\n\nWe can create many more generators by explicitly specializing make_gen for a number of types. But before we do that let's observe the core properties of Genmap(\n                [ugen=std::forward(ugen),\n                 func=std::forward(func)](auto&& t) mutable {\n                    return func(std::forward(t), ugen.generate());\n                });\n    }\n};\n\nauto uppergen = make_range_gen('A', 'Z'+1);\nauto lowergen = make_range_gen('a', 'z'+1);\nauto pairgen  = \n       uppergen.zip2(lowergen, \n                     [](char up, char low) { return std::make_pair(up, low); });\n\n\nThe example above shows how a pair of random characters can be produced by zipping an uppercase generator with a lowercase generator. The zipper function simply constructs the pair from two characters. Alternatively, &std::make_pair would have been sufficient.\n\nThe zip2 function looks significantly more verbose than a comparable implementation in most other languages that support lambdas. A lot of code is devoted to perfect-forwarding of arguments, which is quite necessary for highly composable libraries such as this one. We'll see later that C++ compilers are smart enough to inline the call-chain completely. \n\nAnother example of zip is string generator. A string generator zips a bool generator and int generator where the bool value indicates whether string is empty or not and int generator determines the length of the string. Of course, string generator also needs a char generator to populate the string. Here's one way of doing it.\n\n\ntemplate \nauto make_gen()\n{\n  auto char_gen = make_range_gen(32, 127); // printable characters.\n  auto length_gen = make_range_gen(1, 256);\n\n  return make_gen().zip2(\n                      length_gen,\n                      [char_gen](bool empty, int length) mutable {\n                        std::string str;\n                        if(!empty)\n                        {\n                          str.reserve(length);\n                          for(int i = 0; i < length; ++i)\n                            str.push_back(char_gen.generate());\n                        }\n                        return str;\n                      });\n}\n\n\nThere are many more combinators. The single generator would always produce the same value. The oneOf generator selects one of the elements from a given array non-deterministically. Finally, the amb combinator will use of the two input combinators to produce value. Here's a couple of them.\n\ntemplate \nauto make_single_gen(T&& t)\n{\n    return make_gen_from([t=std::forward(t)]() { return t; });\n}\n\ntemplate \nauto make_oneof_gen(std::initializer_list list)\n{\n    return make_range_gen(0ul, list.size()).map([list](int idx) { return *(list.begin()+idx); }); \n}\n\n\nStateful Generators  \nThe examples we've seen so far are stateless generators. I.e., between two successive calls to generate, no state is updated. Let's look at a stateful generator: fibonacciGen. This generator must maintain at least two integers (a and b) for its computation. \n\nauto fiboGen()\n{\n  int a = 0;\n  int b = 1;\n  return make_gen_from([a, b]() mutable {\n                          int c = a;\n                          a = b;\n                          b = c+b;\n                          return c;\n                       });\n}\n\n\nThe Cost of Functional Design\n\nIt is quite interesting how complex generators can be created from simple generators. But is there a cost to this high level of abstraction? Is the code as fast as it can be? \n\nHere are two different algorithmically identical implementations of bool generator. The reason I chose this algorithm because I wanted make use of zip2, which in turn uses map. I wanted to include multiple levels of indirection.\n\n\nextern "C" bool random_bool1()\n{\n  return (random()-random()) > 0;\n}\n\nextern "C" bool random_bool2()\n{\n  auto boolgen = \n    make_gen()\n           .zip2(make_gen(),\n                 [](long int i, long int j) { return (i-j) > 0; });\n\n  return boolgen.generate();\n}\n\nThe screenshot below shows the compiler's assembly output for both the functions. The amazing fact is that it is exactly identical! The compiler is able to see through the layers and layers of indirections (invocations of lambdas) and is able to produce optimal code for the random_bool functions. That's quite a remarkable feat achieved by g++ 5.1 in this case. Perhaps it is the same with other major C++ compilers.\n\n\n\nGenerator size\n\nThe performance story does not end here though. Note that producing a random boolean does not need any state. I.e., it is just a function. However, RootRandomGen take one byte because it's a class. Every object in C++ must have a unique identity. To ensure that's the case, C++ compiler gives minimal possible size to each object. As we compose higher-level generators from smaller generators, we are clearly creating objects, which have non-zero sizes. But how much memory do they need exactly? What is the size of boolgen in random_bool2? \n\nThe size of boolgen is 3 bytes on my machine. The reason for the state is lambda captures. Both map and zip combinators use lambdas with one or more captures. As higher-level generators are built from lower level generators, the state adds up. The problem is that in most generators we've seen so far, there is no real reason to maintain state between two successive calls to the generate function. I.e, the next value is completely unrelated to the previous values. In fact, as we saw before, the compiler did not refer to any state in the implementation of random_bool2. Of course, for truly stateful generators such as the the fibonacci generator, maintaining state from the prior computation is necessary. \n\nThe build-up of unnecessary state is quite fast though. For instance, the size of the string generator is whopping 28 bytes! The compiler maintains 28 bytes of state and does not serve any obvious purpose to the user! A generator of printable strings implemented as a simple function would require no persistent state at all. As the size of the generators get larger and larger, pretty soon they won't fit in the cache line and will start to degrade performance, especially if truly stateful generators are mixed with only accidently stateful generators. I hope compiler writers will figure something out about this problem.\n\nThis concludes the part 4 in the series of Fun with Lambdas: C++14 Style. I hope you enjoyed it.

87	2016-11-21 00:00:00	Help me sort out the meaning of "{}" as a constructor argument	\n\nIn Effective Modern C++, one of the explanations I have in Item 7 ("Distinguish between () and {} when creating objects") is this:\n\n\nIf you want to call a std::initializer_list constructor with an empty std::initializer_list, you do it by making the empty braces a constructor argument—by putting the empty braces inside the parentheses or braces demarcating what you’re passing:\n\n  \nclass Widget {\npublic:\n  Widget();                                   // default ctor\n  Widget(std::initializer_list il);      // std::initializer_list ctor\n  …                                           // no implicit conversion funcs\n}; \n\nWidget w1;          // calls default ctor\nWidget w2{};        // also calls default ctor\nWidget w3();        // most vexing parse! declares a function!    \n\nWidget w4({});      // calls std::initializer_list ctor with empty list\nWidget w5{{}};      // ditto  \n\n\nI recently got a bug report from Calum Laing saying that in his experience, the initializations of w4 and w5 aren't equivalent, because while w4 behaves as my comment indicates, the initialization of w5 takes place with a std::initializer_list with one element, not zero.\n\nA little playing around showed that he was right, but further playing around showed that changing the example in small ways changed its behavior. In my pre-retirement-from-C++ days, that'd have been my cue to dive into the Standard to figure out what behavior was correct and, more importantly, why, but now that I'm supposed to be kicking back on tropical islands and downing piña coladas by the bucket (a scenario that would be more plausible if I laid around on beaches...or drank), I decided to stop my research at the point where things got complicated. "Use the force of the Internet!," I told myself. In that spirit, let me show you what I've got in the hope that you can tell me why I'm getting it. (Maybe it's obvious. I really haven't thought a lot about C++ since the end of last year.)\n\nMy experiments showed that one factor affecting whether "{{}}" as an argument list yields a zero-length std::initializer_list was whether T had a default constructor, so I threw together some test code involving three classes, two of which could not be default-constructed. I then used both "({})" (note the outer parentheses) and "{{}}" as argument lists to a constructor taking a std::initializer_list for a template class imaginatively named X. When the constructor runs, it displays the number of elements in its std::initializer_list parameter.\n\nHere's the code, where the comments in main show the results I got under all of gcc, clang, and vc++ at rextester.com.  Only one set of results is shown, because all three compilers produced the same output.\n  \n#include \n#include \n\nclass DefCtor {\npublic:\n  DefCtor(){}\n};\n\nclass DeletedDefCtor {\npublic:\n  DeletedDefCtor() = delete;\n};\n\nclass NoDefCtor {\npublic:\n  NoDefCtor(int){}\n};\n\ntemplate\nclass X {\npublic:\n  X() { std::cout < "Def Ctor\\n"; }\n    \n  X(std::initializer_list	The View From Aristeia	http://scottmeyers.blogspot.co.il/2016/11/help-me-sort-out-meaning-of-as.html	Article	3

104	2015-06-22 00:00:00	Effective Modern C++ Now in German!Publishing Effective Modern C++, Part 2	\n\n\n\nI'm told that contracts have been signed to translate Effective Modern C++ into Korean, simplified Chinese, traditional Chinese, Russian, Japanese, German, Polish, Italian, and Portuguese, but the only translation that's made its way to my house is the German one.\n\nFor my past books, bilingual readers have told me that the original (English) version is the best. Even if I didn't know some German, I'd be inclined to say that the same thing applies here, too, if for no other reason than that the American version uses multiple ink colors, while the German version uses only one. (Highlighted code is still highlighted, because it's put in bold face.) If you're comfortable reading technical English, I therefore suggest you go with the English version. Wenn Sie aber finden, dass Sie technische Information besser auf Deutsch aufnehmen und verstehen, dann ist es natürlich sinnvoll, die deutsche Ausgabe vorzuziehen.\n\nI suspect that that last sentence demonstrates why I don't handle the German translation myself :-)\n\nO'Reilly has made the first chapter of the German translation available at the book's web site, so if you'd like to try before you buy, give it a look. That PDF is currently in black and white, but my understanding is that it's supposed to incorporate multiple colors, so you might check back from time to time to see if it's been updated.\n\nViel Spaß beim Effektives modernes C++!\n\nScott\n\n\n\nIn part 1, I divided technical publishing into four tasks (manuscript creation, production, distribution, and marketing), and I gave my perspective on publishing economics from a traditional technical publisher's point of view. In that post, my financial analysis was based on the assumption that most technical books sell no more than 5000 copies. For an author who's already been published, that assumption can be replaced with (or at least tempered by) the author's past performance. In my case, I have a history of five C++ books dating back to 1991. Each has sold more than 5000 copies.\n\nIf I wanted to impress you, I'd tell you that Effective C++, Third Edition, has sold over 225,000 copies, which, if my royalty statements are to believed and my spreadsheet summarizing them is accurate, it has. But then I'd worry that you'd think I light fires with 100-dollar bills and own an island in a tropical paradise. So I'd hasten to add that a great many of those sales took place in foreign countries, where my royalties are...well, let's put it this way: my most recent royalty statement has an entry for 10,000 books in Chinese, and my take was about 27 cents per book. That's not the kind of money that buys islands.\n\nStill, if an author has sold well in the past, that suggests that a publisher is unlikely to lose money on a similar book project by the same author. (I say "similar" projects, because an author's success with topic X may say little about that author's success with topic Y. Donald Knuth is a legendary author in Computer Science, but I don't think his novel burned up the best-seller lists.)\n\nFor an established author, what's a reasonable approach to sharing book revenues with a publisher? I can think of three basic designs:\n\nFlat rate: The author gets a flat percentage of the income produced by the book. Presumably this is a higher rate than an unproven author would receive.\nIncreasing tiers: The author gets a flat rate for the first n books, then a higher rate after that. The lower initial rate permits the publisher to quickly recover their up-front costs. There may be multiple tiers: the more you sell, the higher the rate. For example, Apress's default contract has five tiers, ranging from 10% to 20%.\nDecreasing tiers: The author gets a flat rate for the first n books, then a lower rate \nafter that. The higher initial rate acknowledges that the proven author can sell some books on his or her reputation alone. For such sales, the publisher brings little to the party. As sales rise, the role of the publisher in finding buyers increases, so the publisher deserves a greater share of the revenue.\n\nI don't know anybody who's used a decreasing tiered royalty scheme, but I think it makes sense. The looks on the faces of the few authors and publishers I've mentioned it to suggest that I may be alone in this belief.\n\nSo here's where we stand, or, more accurately, where I stood in early 2014 when I started thinking about signing a publishing contract for Effective Modern C++:\n\nOf the four tasks involved in publishing the book, I wanted to be responsible only for manuscript creation. However, I wanted a voice in some aspects of production (e.g., page layout, use of color, usability on mobile devices) and marketing (e.g., how the book is pitched to prospective buyers).\nI believed that the publisher's distribution and marketing efforts would be an important factor in determining the success of the book, measured both in terms of revenue generated and programmers reached.\nI understood that the publisher had to make a nontrivial investment to bring the book to market, but I felt that my track record as a C++ author (and my lack of a request for an advance) essentially guaranteed that the investment would be recouped.\n\nAddison-Wesley and I undertook negotiations, and they offered generous terms. Compared to the deals most technical authors receive, I was offered more of everything: higher royalties, a bigger voice in production and marketing decisions, greater autonomy as an author--you name it. Had I signed, it would have been the most generous contract I'd had with AW in my nearly quarter century of working with them.\n\n\nUnfortunately, I felt that what AW offered didn't embody a principle I had begun to realize was very important to me: fairness. I believed that the terms of the publishing agreement should fairly reflect our respective contributions to the success of the book. But how do you evaluate that? How do you disentangle the author's contribution to the book's success from that of the publisher?\n\nBeing an author, I felt that the \ncomponent I was tackling--the writing--was the most important of \nthe publishing tasks. Without a manuscript, the world's best production, distribution, and \nmarketing teams have nothing to do. Given a good \nmanuscript, however, anybody can produce PDF and sell it online. That is, they can produce, distribute, and market a book. They may not do it well, but they can do it. It's no longer that difficult to publish something on your own.\n\nAt the same time, professionals versed in production, distribution, and marketing could take my \nmanuscript, make it available in multiple formats on multiple platforms,\n and sell a lot more copies than I could myself. Since 2010, for example, I've sold my annotated training materials through an arrangement with Artima that has me handle manuscript creation and production, while Artima is responsible for online sales and PDF downloads. Compared to "full service" publishing, production and distribution in this arrangement are quite limited (the materials are available only in PDF and at only one web site), and marketing barely exists. Feedback from readers indicates that the content of these publications is good, but sales have been underwhelming.\n\nI conclude that it's not necessary to have skilled people working on production, distribution, and marketing to bring a book to \nmarket, but that doesn't mean those aspects of publishing aren't important. They are.\n\nSo what's fair? If a book bombs, the revenue involved isn't enough to make much difference to either party. The publisher loses money, and the author loses a chunk of his or her life. But if a book is successful--if it earns a zillion dollars over its lifetime--how much of that zillion should go to the author and how much should go to the publisher? What's a fair revenue split?\n\nI ultimately decided that AW's offer, though generous, didn't reflect what I thought was fair. We tried to bridge the gap in various ways, but we weren't able to come to an accord. That's when I approached O'Reilly. I explained what I was looking for in a publishing agreement, i.e., what I considered a fair apportionment between author and publisher of the work to be done and the revenues ultimately received. We quickly agreed on terms, and that, in a nutshell, is why EMC++ is an O'Reilly book.\n\nIn my Advice to Prospective Book Authors, I say:\n\nGiven the uncertain financial return on your authoring effort, I suggest\n    you figure out what's most important to you.  When your book comes out,\n    what will make you say, "I'm happy with the way things went, even if the\n    book sells poorly"?  Do you want to have designed your own cover?  To have\n    had complete editorial control?  To have specified how the book would be\n    marketed?  To have made the text of the book available at your web site?\n    If these things are important to you, you may want to trade them off\n    against financial aspects of the contract.  After all, even if the book\n    sells zero copies, you'll still have designed your own cover, have\n    exercised complete editorial control, have specified how the book would be\n    marketed, etc.  If those things have value to you, I encourage you to find\n    agreement with your editor on them.\nFor EMC++, I ultimately decided that having contract terms I considered fair--not just generous--was\n important enough to warrant changing to a different publisher. I knew \nthat such a shift was accompanied by a Pandora's box of unknowns, but I'm sincere in my advice above, so I decided to \nfollow it myself.\n\nI still work with AW, and I still enjoy \ndoing it. It's still home for my three earlier C++ books, and I still \nact as consulting editor for the increasingly active Effective Software Development Series. (In the past nine months, we've published both Effective Python and Effective Ruby.)\n My decision to publish EMC++ with O'Reilly wasn't an expression of \ndispleasure with AW. It was a reflection of the the fact that, \ntaking everything into account, O'Reilly was a better match for the kind of arrangement I wanted to have with my publisher for Effective Modern C++.\n\nScott\n\n	The View From Aristeia	http://scottmeyers.blogspot.co.il/2015/06/effective-modern-c-now-in-german.html	Article	3

119	2010-04-05 00:00:00	Timeouts by analogy	\nMost networking-enabled applications have to deal with timeouts. Read or write operations may continue indefinitely, and programs need a way to determine when to tear down connections, resend requests, or take whatever other measures are necessary.Asio includes the deadline_timer class for managing timeouts. This class aims to provide a minimal interface for scheduling events. Of course, minimalism gives little in the way of design guidance, so some users struggle in finding an elegant way to incorporate timers and timeouts into their programs.From the minimalist perspective of Asio, there's no one true right way to do it. (Perhaps there's no better proof of that than my design preferences having changed over the years.) Yet that answer doesn't get programs written, so in this post I will try to present a simple mental model for managing timers.Parking metersHigh-traffic, commercial areas near where I live have limited on-street parking. The street parking that is available is metered. It's the usual drill:Park your vehicle.Feed some coins into the parking meter (or, as is more likely these days, swipe your credit card or send an SMS).Go do whatever you came to do.Make sure you return to your vehicle before the meter expires.If you don't get back in time, you'd better hope your vehicle hasn't had a visit from the parking inspector. A visit means a ticket under the wipers and a nasty fine due.Parking meters are a good analogy for reasoning about timeouts because it's easy to identify the two actors:The driver of the vehicle.The parking inspector.The driver performs the following steps:Feeds the meter.Leaves the vehicle to run some errands.Returns to the vehicle.If no ticket has been issued, repeats from step 1.If a fine has been issued, goes home.The parking inspector's job is simple:Checks whether the meter has expired.If the meter has expired, writes up a ticket.If the meter has not expired, notes how much time is remaining.Goes off for a walk until the remaining time has elapsed.Using the analogy to inform program designHopefully you've already guessed how these actors map to networked applications:The driver represents your protocol handling code.The parking inspector corresponds to your timeout management logic.Let's take a look at how this works in a very simple use case.// The "driver" actor.void session::handle_read(error_code ec, size_t length){  // On entering this function we have returned to the vehicle.  if (!ec)  {    // Phew, no ticket. Feed the meter.    my_timer.expires_from_now(seconds(5));    // Process incoming data.    // ...    // Run some more errands.    my_socket.async_read_some(buffer(my_buffer),        bind(&session::handle_read, this, _1, _2));  }  else  {    // We got a ticket. Go home.  }}// The "parking inspector" actor.void session::handle_timeout(error_code ec){  // On entering this function we are checking the meter.  // Has the meter expired?  if (my_timer.expires_from_now() < seconds(0))  {    // Write up a ticket.    my_socket.close();  }  else  {    // Note remaining time and go for a walk.    my_timer.async_wait(        bind(&session::handle_timeout, this, _1));  }}It's important to remember that the driver may need to run multiple errands each time they leave the vehicle. In protocol terms, you might have a fixed-length header followed by a variable-length body. You only want to "feed the meter" once you have received a complete message:// First part of the "driver" actor.void session::handle_read_header(error_code ec){  // We're not back at the vehicle yet.  if (!ec)  {    // Process header.    // ...    // Run some more errands.    async_read(my_socket, buffer(my_body),        bind(&session::handle_read_body, this, _1));  }}// Second part of the "driver" actor.void session::handle_read_body(error_code ec){  // On entering this function we have returned to the vehicle.  if (!ec)  {    // Phew, no ticket. Feed the meter.    my_timer.expires_from_now(seconds(5));    // Process complete message.    // ...    // Run some more errands.    async_read(my_socket, buffer(my_header),        bind(&session::handle_read_header, this, _1));  }  else  {    // We got a ticket. Go home.  }}There are many variations on this theme. For example, you may feed the meter between consecutive errands, varying the amount of money inserted (i.e. setting different length timeouts) depending on which errand comes next. In protocol terms, that might mean allowing up to 30 seconds between messages, but only a further 5 seconds is permitted once the message header has been received.As I indicated earlier, there's no single right way to manage timeouts. In fact, there are many different facets to this problem that are probably worth exploring in their own right. However, I think that the approach shown here is probably suited to most applications and I would recommend it as a starting point when designing your timeout handling.\n\n	Thinking Asynchronously in C++	http://blog.think-async.com/2010/04/timeouts-by-analogy.html	Article	3

It is easy to implement vector/matrix arithmetic, but when performance is needed, we often resort to a highly optimized BLAS implementation, such as ATLAS and OpenBLAS. Are these libraries much faster than our own implementations? Is it worth introducing a dependency to BLAS if you only need basic vector/matrix arithmetic? The following post may give you some hints.

209	2009-07-28 00:00:00	String literals in C++	\nHere's a short one on string literals in C++. Ask yourself: what is their type? It is 'array of n const char', correct! So, we might think:    char* literal = "Hello World!";would be "invalid"/"illegal" in C++. But you'd be surprised it is not and even Comeau online compiles it successfully without even a warning. The C++ standard, however, tries to protect you hinting that the above is wrong by stating that it is a deprecated feature in C++ that probably was allowed to keep backward compatibility with C.Here is what the standard says as part of section [2.13.4/2]:[quote]A string literal that does not begin with u, U, or L is an ordinary string literal, also referred to as a narrow string literal. An ordinary string literal has type “array of n const char”, where n is the size of the string as defined below; it has static storage duration (3.7) and is initialized with the given characters.[/quote]So, the following would have definitely been invalid in C++:    char* literal = "Hello World!";"Hello World!" is an array of 13 [spooky :-)] constant characters. 'literal' is the pointer to the first element of the array and since that element is const, the pointer cannot be declared as a non-const char*. The pointer has to be of the type 'pointer to a const char'.But as mentioned above, to have backward compatibility with C where the above works an implicit conversion is defined for array to pointer conversion where a string literal would be converted to an r-value of type "pointer to a char". The standard mentions this in section [4.2/2]:[quote]A string literal (2.13.4) with no prefix, with a u prefix, with a U prefix, or with an L prefix can be converted to an rvalue of type “pointer to char”, “pointer to char16_t”, “pointer to char32_t”, or “pointer to wchar_t”, respectively. In any case, the result is a pointer to the first element of the array. This conversion is considered only when there is an explicit appropriate pointer target type, and not when there is a general need to convert from an lvalue to an rvalue. [ Note: this conversion is deprecated. See Annex D. —end note ][/quote]But, the thing to be happy about is the note above, that is re-iterated in Annexure D section [D.4/1] as:[quote]The implicit conversion from const to non-const qualification for string literals (4.2) is deprecated.[/quote]So, best is to keep the good habit of declaring the pointer to the literal as a pointer to a const. :-)[The C++ standard's draft version used for quotes above, has document number : N2315=07-0175 dated 2007-06-25]\n\n	Learning C++	http://learningcppisfun.blogspot.co.il/2009/07/string-literals-in-c.html	Article	3

The previous two posts shed light on the history and the current issues with cpp-netlib's implementation and why we'd like to make changes to the client and server API now. In this post we look at the details of the design document which outlines this new API. Our eventual goal is to get to a point where the API is ready for proposal to the C++ committee as a reference implementation. If you haven't read the document yet, please do that now before proceeding any further -- or keep it open in a separate tab/window so you can refer to the sections appropriate in the discussions below.In the document we list out a few goals. Let me list those down here too just for convenience:Support configurability.Support fully asynchronous operation.Streaming should be a first-class concept.Basic session and authentication support should be built-in.Use standard C++11 libraries and features.Let me go through each of these goals in a little more detail.ConfigurabilityA lot of HTTP is about options on how the client behaves and how requests are processed. Artificially limiting the configurability of a client is bad design not only for users but also for implementers. The current latest version of the library doesn't support many options largely because the API has not been designed to be configurable in the beginning. The mistake here was thinking that configuration would be complicated so we rather provide "sane" defaults -- unfortunately the defaults though are still hard to change and that's not a good user experience. For something that's meant to be a full-featured HTTP client or server, configurability is an essential feature. We aim to change that by introducing a configuration idiom that is extensible and familiar.namespace http = network::http;http::client_options options;options.follow_redirects(true)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.accept_encoding({"*/*"})&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.version(http::version::http_1_1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.proxy("localhost:8080")&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.idle_timeout(30);http::client client{options};If you look closely at the above code, the configuration is as declarative as possible and in case we do support new options later on adding those in would be a matter of adding new function calls. This lets us, the implementers, support configuration options incrementally without having to jump through too many hoops. A similar approach is done for setting per-request options.namespace http = network::http;http::request_options ro;ro.timeout(std::chrono::duration(30))&nbsp;&nbsp;.client_cert("/tmp/my_cert.pem")&nbsp;&nbsp;.accept_transfer_encoding({http::transfer_encodings::gzip, http::transfer_encodings::plain});auto response = client.get("https://www.example.com/foo", ro);Now in this case we're setting the options both on a request level and a client level. We're allowing this so that we can override client-specific options on a per-request basis. This gives the library a fully configurable interface in the case where we do want configuration. The basics will still be choosing defaults, which makes this a very attractive approach.namespace http = network::http;http::client client;auto response = client.get("https://www.example.com/foo");The main direction the library is going is that of "making simple things easy and making complex things possible".&nbsp;We achieve this in the client following the above pattern. For the server implementation though we allow configuring the server dispatch instead of making users roll their own dispatch mechanism, and make configuration the default way of using the server implementation.namespace http = network::http;http::server server_;server_.register_handler(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"/hello", [](session&amp; s, std::shared_ptr&lt;connection&gt; c) {&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c-&gt;response().write(s["user"].empty()? string("world!") : s["user"]);&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;});server_.register_handler(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"/echo", [](session&amp; s, std::shared_ptr&lt;connection&gt; c) {&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (c-&gt;method() != http::server::POST) {&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c-&gt;response().write("echo!");&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c-&gt;data().read(getpagesize(), [c](const std::string&amp; data) {&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (!data.empty())&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c-&gt;response().write(data);&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;});&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;});s.run();The intent is to configure a server more than to implement one. There are more details on the document about changes to the HTTP server API so please have a read of that to get more of the elaboration.Fully Asynchronous OperationThe library has traditionally been mixing both synchronous and asynchronous APIs in a very clumsy way. Thankfully though with C++11 we have a de facto way of doing asynchronous APIs in the form of std::future. This handy utility along with a standardized means of performing asynchronous operations with std::async makes it a very attractive option for simplifying asynchronous programming with C++.In the previous code snippets using http::client you'll find a response object whose type was deduced using auto. Changes to the API will make calls to the http::client functions return std::future objects. The intent of this is to convey directly through the API that all the calls made to the client are asynchronous. There are many standard ways of dealing with future objects, which allows users to easily schedule multiple concurrent requests.namespace http = network::http;std::future&lt;http::response&gt; response_future =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;client.get("http://www.google.com/");  // returns immediatelyhttp::response actual_response =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;response_future.get();  // will move instead of copyAs an aside, in the future it's highly likely that std::future will gain a "then" member function that allows you to define a completion handler when the future is ready. Until then, explicitly waiting on a future is best supported.In the server implementation all the function calls associated with the response are all asynchronous. There are a lot of details when it comes to the server implementation that's covered better in the document.First-Class StreamingThe current implementation of body streaming is very clunky and is a big source of confusion on how to best handle based on the interface. This stems from the problem that the API was not designed to meet the streaming use-case from day one. The plan is to change this and support streaming as a first-class (and in fact, the preferred) operating mode.In the Client API, we have two chances for supporting streaming: when requesting and when handling responses. Given that we already have a means of waiting for future responses, we also define a clear way of providing streamed data to requests. It used to be that the payload for HTTP requests would need to fit in the client's memory (in a std::string at that) but now we've changed this to allow streaming from an arbitrary byte source.namespace http = network::http;namespace util = network::util;http::client client;auto fr = client.get(&nbsp;&nbsp;{"https://www.myservice.com/",&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;util::gzip_encode(new file_byte_source{"/tmp/data"})}&nbsp;&nbsp;);  // we're gzip encoding the request bodyauto r = fr.get();std::string data = r.read(getpagesize()).get();while (!data.empty()) {&nbsp;&nbsp;std::cout &lt;&lt; data;&nbsp;&nbsp;data = r.read(getpagesize()).get();}  // will print data as it comesWhen reading the response body in chunks notice that we are also using futures, this time std::future. We're relying on move assignment and move construction for this interface so that we are consistent with all the APIs where we support asynchronous operations.In the Server API we're dropping support for the synchronous implementation. Going forward operations on the connection API imply streaming (and chunked, depending on client request properties like HTTP version supported and whether chunked transfer encoding is supported) body responses.Basic Session and Authentication SupportThis goal applies to client and server code. One of the biggest feature requests has been to support cookie processing for both client request/responses as well as for server-side processing (setting/retrieving cookies, etc.). Because precisely everyone is eventually going to need this, the library will support this from configuration options on the client and the server-side. Only basic support will be added and hopefully when the infrastructure has been laid down others will be able to contribute different kinds of session and/or authentication managers.On the server side session parsing will be first class but will depend on a SessionManager policy. This policy can be controlled both statically or can be plugged in dynamically. An API for the SessionManager will be provided when the server is actually implemented.On the client side session management will be plugged-in dynamically and supported on both the client and per-request options. Essentially cookie parsing and variable management will be hooked into the request and response handling. The basic cookie management facility will be provided, but in the future different strategies like encrypted cookies and OAuth2-style digesting among other things will be implemented.C++11 Features and LibrariesNeedless to say (and as should be obvious in the examples) the full power of C++11 will be used in both features and libraries. This will make cpp-netlib less reliant on Boost for things like function&lt;&gt;, move(...), shared_ptr&lt;&gt;, and even Asio (since stand-alone Asio already has support for C++11 features). I've already mentioned std::future, std::thread, and std::async and it's worth noting the welcome language feature called lambda's will make all this really fun to code.The over-arching goal is really two-fold: implement a modern C++ networking library for wide availability and contribute to the C++ standards whenever possible. We've taken the URI proposal to the committee and hopefully some time in 2013 we can bring cpp-netlib's HTTP interface and implementation experience to the committee as well.ConclusionThis concludes the three-part series on cpp-netlib's history, current state, and future direction. There's been a lot of lessons learned with the implementation of cpp-netlib over the past five years and I'm personally thankful for all the effort people have already put into it all these years. The feedback we get from users and contributions we get from like-minded developers makes cpp-netlib a project worth continuing to work on for me. Even though goals have changed and we're reaching higher and getting more ambitious, I personally stay committed to making sure the project and the community grows to become something that users, contributors, and observers can be proud of.Thanks for reading and I'll hope to see you in the mailing list discussions!-- Dean Michael Berris, Founder and Maintainer of The C++ Network Library ProjectIf you liked the direction of the HTTP Client/Server API in cpp-netlib please let us know at the cpp-netlib mailing list.

55	2012-01-13 14:35:00	C++ Extensions: Rich Pointers	Some time towards the end of 2011 I officially became a member of the ISO C++ Committee as part of Google's delegation. Around the same time I wrote about a few extensions to C++ that I wanted to propose or at least help champion to the next version of C++. The Kona meeting is just around the corner and I'm just about ready to make a case for a specific new extension to C++ that I wrote a paper about called rich pointers. This post is about the motivations behind the extension.It's 2012 and I've pretty much started it off with a very ambitious project: to add a new pointer type to C++ with something called "rich pointers". This project aims to achieve the following:Define a new pointer type that conveys semantics different from the primitive pointers inherited from C.Associates an object's type to the pointer instead of the object.Provide a richer reflection and runtime introspection facility for C++ types referred through rich pointers.Attempts to standardize a runtime interface for managing types and these rich pointers.Here are a few motivating examples for why a new pointer type would be required instead of shoehorning the reflection information into current RTTI implementations.Suppose we want to implement serialization on any type of object that has a member function called "serialize", how would we do this from a function that's provided through a DLL?We're implementing a distributed service and we'd like to use Google Protocol Buffers as the data interchange object but also want to render the information using the Qt GUI framework on the client side. How do we do this with as little overhead as possible and without having to adapt the type of the protocol buffer into something that the Qt GUI framework will understand?Let's say we want a generic registry of handlers implemented as dynamically linked modules for a server application and we want to minimize the requirement for downtime of the application as we add new functionality to it. How do we ensure that the new types introduced in the dynamically linked modules are dealt with accordingly by the server application?Suppose we're hosting a just-in-time (JIT) compiler that can compile C++ code in a long-running application. We're doing this so that we can reprogram parts of the application according to runtime constraints/inputs (imagine a query optimizer for SQL databases or for regular expressions) for efficiency concerns. How do we allow the new types defined in the runtime-compiled C++ code to be used in the host application in a type-safe manner?These are just a number of real-world requirements that rich pointers intends to address and enable in a standardized manner. To get this done I'd have to convince the committee that:Adding a new pointer type unique to C++ and having rich runtime type information is necessary to enable seamless solutions for these kinds of problems.Requiring the compiler to generate type information for types referred to via rich pointers is doable and will not lead to overly bloated binaries.Attaching type information to a pointer instead of the object makes sense.Current RTTI mechanisms are inadequate to achieve this kind of reflection and runtime type introspection.Implementing this feature will not require too much heavy lifting for implementors.This paper also implies and relies on the following being true:That C++ modules will define how dynamically and statically shared C++ libraries will be defined (maintaining backward compatibility to existing linkers).That the committee will agree to have a standardized API for accessing details about an application's runtime (for type registration, function registration, certain system characteristics of the machine and implementation, etc.).Runtime introspection is something we'd like to support at the language level because everyone else who needs this functionality has implemented a library that provides this feature in an inadequate and clumsy manner.In the coming days I will be updating the post with a link to the actual document hosted in the ISO C++ Committee mailings page. I certainly look forward to shedding more details about this project and update everyone of the progress of this proposal and perhaps post some insider notes about the upcoming meeting in Kona, Hawaii.Thank you and I do hope to be able to give more details soon.\r\n             \r\n	Cpp Soup	http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/CppSoup/~3/KcLNehx_mFk/c-extensions-rich-pointers.html	Article	3

This release is the final release that I will be managing and starting now I am on the lookout for others who would be interested in continuing the development of the library. I will still host the project on Github and I will still be available to answer questions but I will no longer be actively developing and adding new features to the library. If you or someone you know might be interested in taking over the project please let me know and join the user group as well. I had fun developing the library when I was still at Friendster and even though it's a little hard to acknowledge that a project is being retired, but my focus now has been put elsewhere -- and more recently the C++ Network Library is really what I'd like to focus on. Thank you to everyone who's checked the code out and those that are using it in production even up to this day.\r\n             \r\n	Cpp Soup	http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/CppSoup/~3/P6bw39-l7vQ/memcache-0122-out-last-release-by-me.html	Article	3

113	2010-04-14 00:00:00	System error support in C++0x - part 5	\n[ part 1, part 2, part 3, part 4 ]Creating your own error conditionsUser-extensibility in the  facility is not limited to error codes: error_condition permits the same customisation.Why create custom error conditions?To answer this question, let's revisit the distinction between error_code and error_condition:class error_code - represents a specific error value returned by an operation (such as a system call).class error_condition - something that you want to test for and, potentially, react to in your code.This suggests some use cases for custom error conditions:Abstraction of OS-specific errors.Let's say you're writing a portable wrapper around getaddrinfo(). Two interesting error conditions are the tentative "the name does not resolve at this time, try again later", and the authoritative "the name does not resolve". The getaddrinfo() function reports these errors as follows:On POSIX platforms, the errors are EAI_AGAIN and EAI_NONAME, respectively. The error values are in a distinct "namespace" to errno values. This means you will have to implement a new error_category to capture the errors.On Windows, the errors are WSAEAI_AGAIN and WSAEAI_NONAME. Although the names are similar to the POSIX errors, they share the GetLastError "namespace". Consequently, you may want to reuse std::system_category() to capture and represent getaddrinfo() errors on this platform.To avoid discarding information, you want to preserve the original OS-specific error code while providing two error conditions (called name_not_found_try_again and name_not_found, say) that API users can test against.Giving context-specific meaning to generic error codes.Most POSIX system calls use errno to report errors. Rather than define new errors for each function, the same errors are reused and you may have to look at the corresponding man page to determine the meaning. If you implement your own abstractions on top of these system calls, this context is lost to the user.For example, say you want to implement a simple database where each entry is stored in a separate flat file. When you try to read an entry, the database calls open() to access the file. This function sets errno to ENOENT if the file does not exist.As the database's storage mechanism is abstracted from the user, it could be surprising to ask them to test for no_such_file_or_directory. Instead, you can create your own context-specific error condition, no_such_entry, which is equivalent to ENOENT.Testing for a set of related errors.As your codebase grows, you might find the same set of errors are checked again and again. Perhaps you need to respond to low system resources:not_enough_memoryresource_unavailable_try_againtoo_many_files_opentoo_many_files_open_in_system...in several places, but the subsequent action differs at each point of use. This shows that there is a more general condition, "the system resources are low", that you want to test for and react to in your code.A custom error condition, low_system_resources, can be defined so that its equivalence is based on a combination of other error conditions. This allows you to write each test as:if (ec == low_system_resources)  ...and so eliminate the repetition of individual tests.The definition of custom error conditions is similar to the method for error_codes, as you will see in the steps below.Step 1: define the error valuesYou need to create an enum for the error values, similar to std::errc:enum class api_error{  low_system_resources = 1,  ...  name_not_found,  ...  no_such_entry};The actual values you use are not important, but you must ensure that they are distinct and non-zero.Step 2: define an error_category classAn error_condition object consists of both an error value and a category. To create a new category, you must derive a class from error_category:class api_category_impl  : public std::error_category{public:  virtual const char* name() const;  virtual std::string message(int ev) const;  virtual bool equivalent(      const std::error_code& code,      int condition) const;};Step 3: give the category a human-readable nameThe error_category::name() virtual function must return a string identifying the category:const char* api_category_impl::name() const{  return "api";}Step 4: convert error conditions to stringsThe error_category::message() function converts an error value into a string that describes the error:std::string api_category_impl::message(int ev) const{  switch (ev)  {  case api_error::low_system_resources:    return "Low system resources";  ...  }}However, depending on your use case, it may be unlikely that you'll ever call error_condition::message(). In that case, you can take a shortcut and simply write:std::string api_category_impl::message(int ev) const{  return "api error";}Step 5: implement error equivalenceThe error_category::equivalent() virtual function is used to define equivalence between error codes and conditions. In fact, there are two overloads of the error_category::equivalent() function. The first:virtual bool equivalent(int code,    const error_condition& condition) const;is used to establish equivalence between error_codes in the current category with arbitrary error_conditions. The second overload:virtual bool equivalent(    const error_code& code,    int condition) const;defines equivalence between error_conditions in the current category with error_codes from any category. Since you are creating custom error conditions, it is the second overload that you must override.Defining equivalence is simple: return true if you want an error_code to be equivalent to your condition, otherwise return false.If your intent is to abstract OS-specific errors, you might implement error_category::equivalent() like this:bool api_category_impl::equivalent(    const std::error_code& code,    int condition) const{  switch (condition)  {  ...  case api_error::name_not_found:#if defined(_WIN32)    return code == std::error_code(        WSAEAI_NONAME, system_category());#else    return code = std::error_code(        EAI_NONAME, getaddrinfo_category());#endif  ...  default:    return false;  }}(Obviously getaddrinfo_category() needs to be defined somewhere too.)The tests can be as complex as you like, and can even reuse other error_condition constants. You may want to do this if you're creating a context-specific error condition, or testing for a set of related errors:bool api_category_impl::equivalent(    const std::error_code& code,    int condition) const{  switch (condition)  {  case api_error::low_system_resources:    return code == std::errc::not_enough_memory      || code == std::errc::resource_unavailable_try_again      || code == std::errc::too_many_files_open      || code == std::errc::too_many_files_open_in_system;  ...  case api_error::no_such_entry:    return code == std::errc::no_such_file_or_directory;  default:    return false;  }}Step 6: uniquely identify the categoryYou should provide a function to return a reference to a category object:const std::error_category& api_category();such that it always returns a reference to the same object. As with custom error codes, you can use a global:api_category_impl api_category_instance;const std::error_category& api_category(){  return api_category_instance;}or you can make use of C++0x's thread-safe static variables:const std::error_category& api_category(){  static api_category_impl instance;  return instance;}Step 7: construct an error_condition from the enumThe  implementation requires a function called make_error_condition() to associate an error value with a category:std::error_condition make_error_condition(api_error e){  return std::error_condition(      static_cast(e),      api_category());}For completeness, you should also provide the equivalent function for construction of an error_code. I'll leave that as an exercise for the reader.Step 8: register for implicit conversion to error_conditionFinally, for the api_error enumerators to be usable as error_condition constants, enable the conversion constructor using the is_error_condition_enum type trait:namespace std{  template   struct is_error_condition_enum    : public true_type {};}Using the error conditionsThe api_error enumerators can now be used as error_condition constants, just as you may use those defined in std::errc:std::error_code ec;load_resource("http://some/url", ec);if (ec == api_error::low_system_resources)  ...As I've said several times before, the original error code is retained and no information is lost. It doesn't matter whether that error code came from the operating system or from an HTTP library with its own error category. Your custom error conditions can work equally well with either.Next, in what will probably be the final instalment, I'll discuss how to design APIs that use the  facility.\n\n	Thinking Asynchronously in C++	http://blog.think-async.com/2010/04/system-error-support-in-c0x-part-5.html	Article	3

156	2009-03-18 00:00:00	Jakob Nielsen Post on Kindle-Friendly Content	\nThe TOC Blog pointed me to Jakob Nielsen's recent post, "Kindle Content Design."  Nielsen raises a number of interesting issues, and in general I think we're in violent agreement, but his post ends with this:Since I started writing Alertbox in 1995, it's been a recurring theme to design for the medium. In the beginning, this meant "don't design your website like a glossy brochure." (I.e., print design is different than online design.)  For Kindle, it's certainly unacceptable to simply repurpose print content. But you can't repurpose website content, either. For good Kindle usability, you have to design for the Kindle. Write Kindle-specific headlines and create Kindle-specific article structures. I fully agree with the part about designing for the medium, but I don't think Kindle is a medium in and of itself.  There are a number of other dedicated book-reading devices, and my guess is that they are similar enough to one another that it's possible to design for the entire category.   As an author, I don't want to try to create content on a device-by-device basis, I want to do it on a device-category-by-device-category basis.  That may not yield optimal content presentation for every device, but it should yield acceptable presentation for devices I know about as well as devices I don't know about (e.g., that are introduced after I've finished writing).  Yes, my software development roots keep showing:  I approach cross-platform content authoring the same way I approach cross-platform software authoring.\n\n	The Fastware Project	http://fastwareproject.blogspot.co.il/2009/03/jakob-nielsen-post-on-kindle-friendly.html	Article	3

117	2010-04-07 00:00:00	System error support in C++0x - part 1	\nAmong the many new library features in C++0x is a little header called . It provides a selection of utilities for managing, well, system errors. The principal components defined in the header are:class error_categoryclass error_codeclass error_conditionclass system_errorenum class errcI had a hand in the design of this facility, so in this series of posts I will try to capture the rationale, history, and intended uses of the various components.Where to get itA complete implementation, and one that supports C++03, is included in Boost. I'd guess that, at this point in time, it is probably the best tested implementation in terms of portability. Of course, you have to spell things starting with boost::system:: rather than std::.An implementation is included with GCC 4.4 and later. However, you must compile your program with the -std=c++0x option in order to use it.Finally, Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 will ship with an implementation of the classes. The main limitation is that the system_category() does not represent Win32 errors as was intended. More on what that means later.(Note that these are just the implementations that I am aware of. There may be others.)OverviewHere are the types and classes defined by , in a nutshell:class error_category - intended as a base class, an error_category is used to define sources of errors or categories of error codes and conditions.class error_code - represents a specific error value returned by an operation (such as a system call).class error_condition - something that you want to test for and, potentially, react to in your code.class system_error - an exception used to wrap error_codes when an error is to be reported via throw/catch.enum class errc - a set of generic error condition values, derived from POSIX.is_error_code_enum, is_error_condition_enum, make_error_code, make_error_condition - a mechanism for converting enum class error values into error_codes or error_conditions.generic_category() - returns a category object used to classify the errc-based error codes and conditions.system_category() - returns a category object used for error codes that originate from the operating system.PrinciplesThis section lists some of the guiding principles I had in mind in designing the facility. (I cannot speak for the others involved.) As with most software projects, some were goals at the outset and some were picked up along the way.Not all errors are exceptionalSimply put, exceptions are not always the right way to handle errors. (In some circles this is a controversial statement, although I really don't understand why.)In network programming, for example, there are commonly encountered errors such as:You were unable to connect to a remote IP address.Your connection dropped out.You tried to open an IPv6 socket but no IPv6 network interfaces are available.Sure, these might be exceptional conditions, but equally they may be handled as part of normal control flow. If you reasonably expect it to happen, it's not exceptional. Respectively:The IP address is one of a list of addresses corresponding to a host name. You want to try connecting to the next address in the list.The network is unreliable. You want to try to reestablish the connection and only give up after N failures.Your program can drop back to using an IPv4 socket.Another requirement, in the case of Asio, was a way to pass the result of an asynchronous operation to its completion handler. In this case, I want the operation's error code to be an argument to the handler callback. (An alternative approach is to provide a means to rethrow an exception inside the handler, such as .NET's BeginXYZ/EndXYZ asynchronous pattern. In my opinion, that design adds complexity and makes the API more error-prone.)Last, but not least, some domains will be unable or unwilling to use exceptions due to code size and performance constraints.In short: be pragmatic, not dogmatic. Use whatever error mechanism suits best in terms of clarity, correctness, constraints, and, yes, even personal taste. Often the right place to make the decision between exception and error code is at the point of use. That means a system error facility should support both.Errors come from multiple sourcesThe C++03 standard recognises errno as a source of error codes. This is used by the stdio functions, some math functions, and so forth.On POSIX platforms, many system operations do use errno to propagate errors. POSIX defines additional errno error codes to cover these cases.Windows, on the other hand, does not make use of errno beyond the standard C library. Windows API calls typically report their errors via GetLastError.When one considers network programming, the getaddrinfo family of functions uses its own set of error codes (EAI_...) on POSIX, but shares the GetLastError() "namespace" on Windows. Programs that integrate other libraries (for SSL, regular expressions, or whatever) will encounter other categories of error code.Programs should be able to manage these error codes in a consistent manner. I'm especially concerned with enabling composition of operations to create higher-level abstractions. Combining system calls, getaddrinfo, SSL and regular expressions into one API should not force the user of that API to deal with an explosion of error code types. The addition of a new error source to the implementation of that API should not change the interface.Be user-extensibleUsers of the standard library need to be able to add their own error sources. This ability may just be used to integrate a third-party library, but is also tied in with the desire to create higher-level abstractions. When developing a protocol implementation such as HTTP, I want to be able to add a set of error codes corresponding to the errors defined in the RFC.Preserve the original error codeThis was not one of my original goals: my thinking was that the standard would provide a set of well-known error codes. If a system operation returned an error, it was the responsibility of the library to translate the error into a well-known code (if such a mapping made sense).Fortunately, someone showed me the error of my ways. Translating an error code discards information: the error returned by the underlying system call is lost. This may not be a big deal in terms of program control flow, but it matters a lot for program supportability. There is no doubt that programmers will use a standardised error code object for logging and tracing, and the original error may be vital in diagnosing problems.This final principle segues nicely into my topic for part 2: error_code vs error_condition. Stay tuned.\n\n	Thinking Asynchronously in C++	http://blog.think-async.com/2010/04/system-error-support-in-c0x-part-1.html	Article	3

This is especially useful for TCP reads when there's already data in the network stack's buffers, or writes when there is space in the buffers. Whilst there are design issues that must be taken into consideration before simply enabling this flag (beware recursion!) there's a little known issue where code outside of your control can prevent the IOCP from operating correctly when this flag is enabled.

There will never be a "second edition" to buy anew.  Pay once, and you get free updates as long as I produce them.\nThere's more to the sales pitch, but you can get the full spiel here.  The complete background story is available here.\n\nFrom a Fastware! point of view, the fact that I can now put development of C++0x materials and preparing them for publication behind me means I can finally get back to work on Fastware!, and in fact I've already done so.  I'm currently working on a presentation entitled "CPU Caches and Why You Care," which is directly tied to material I plan to put in Fastware!.\n\n\nScott\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n	The Fastware Project	http://fastwareproject.blogspot.co.il/2010/05/new-publishing-project-unveiled.html	Article	3

While React JS has the benefit of the highly-regarded React Router, such a comprehensive routing solution doesn’t exist yet in the React Native community. In fact, React Native’s routing landscape has been in constant upheaval for the last year. The library itself has official three ‘navigators’ for handling decision making on which components to show the user, including ‘NavigatorIOS’, ‘Navigator’, and - more recently - ‘NavigatorExperimental’. The open source community likewise has the packages ‘React Native Router Flux’, ‘React Native Router Native’, and ‘React Native Redux Router’, which of which are in various states of completion, or, more commonly, disrepair.

They can even be accessed without any instance. The way to refer to them in your code is as shown below:[CODE]class Test{    private:        static const std::string className;    public:        static const std::string& getClassName()        {            return className;        }    //other members};int main(){    std::cout < Test::getClassName();}It is also allowed to be able to access the static members via an instance/object as below: (modifying the above main function and keeping reset the same)int main(){    Test testObject;    std::cout < testObject.getClassName();}Usually though, it is better to use the previous notation using the scope resolution operator (op '::'). That makes the code more readable in the sense that you know it is a static member and not a non-static one. It speaks for itself.\n\n	Learning C++	http://learningcppisfun.blogspot.co.il/2009/03/accessing-static-members-of-class.html	Article	3

And React does an absolutely amazing job of this.

The blog has been silent since my promise last July to return to work on the book later that month, and while it's true that other projects have soaked up most of my time since then, I have managed to add some sources to the spreadsheet.   I've uploaded the revised version, and, as before, you'll find a link to that spreadsheet at the Fastware! web site.I still plan to get back to Fastware! as my primary project soon, but that's been the case for months, so I'm not going to make any predictions regarding when it will actually take place.  I will say that one of the things taking up a lot of my time has been a new publishing project that I expect to be able to announce within the next few weeks.  It's not specifically related to Fastware!, but it does relate to the publishing-related issues I've raised in this blog.

High on the list is the use of physical styles instead of logical ones, the poster child for which is the use of italics to style text instead of a logical style like "Book Title."  The problem is that the use of italics can be for emphasis, for the title of a publication, for the introduction of a new term, and more.  A well-styled manuscript will use only logical style names -- never raw italics. Alas, nearly every authoring system I know goes out of its way to make it easy to italicize text.  WYSIWYG systems (at least those on Windows) define ^I to mean "italicize the selection", HTML offers \\i, LaTeX  has \\it, reST offers *text*, etc.  It's a similar situation for making things bold or underlined,  both of which are also physical styles and should thus be avoided. From what I can tell, there is no notion of "italicization" in the DocBook or DTBook schemas, and the screen shot for oXygen's XML Author for DocBook shows a toolbar button only to emphasize text, not italicize it.  Score one for XML.I've decided to use FrameMaker, not XML, so I'll be working in WYSIWYGland.  I'm still committed to using only logical styles, and although I'm a pretty disciplined guy, I have no illusions that I'm perfect.  If I don't find a way to keep myself from doing it, I know I'll occasionally type ^I (or ^B for bold) in FrameMaker without thinking about it.  I won't notice my formatting faux pas (note use of italics to indicate a foreign expression, which is quite different from using them to emphasize something or to indicate a book title), because everything in my WYSIWYG world will look right.  The situation would likely be the same in an italics-supporting markup-based world such as LaTeX or reST. Fortunately, FrameMaker's keyboard and menu command set is determined by configuration files, so, with some guidance from the kind folks at the FrameMaker forum, I was able to excise keyboard and toolbar commands for  italics, bold, and underlining.  Now, should I foolishly try to italicize something via the errant ^I, nothing happens.\n\n	The Fastware Project	http://fastwareproject.blogspot.co.il/2009/03/saving-myself-from-physical-formatting.html	Article	3

295	2017-03-16 12:15:00	What exactly is React?	React is often described as “the V in the MVC structure”. This also happens to be the least tangible explanation one could give a newcomer, as (V)iews are typically logic-less files that are driven by a controller. Further, frameworks like Angular, Backbone, Ember, and more already have sufficient view layers — which then begs the question, why do we need to replace the V in MVC with React?

But since I started going deeper into React I have seen all this “cool” node modules that are extremely badly developed. They follow no rules, the components are way too big. They use state for pretty much everything, and they don’t leverage dumb components. Anyone with enough experience understands how much of a hassle this is to maintain …	The Blue Coder	https://www.thebluecoder.com/2017/02/14/react-best-practices-and-useful-functions/	Article	27
207	2010-04-02 00:00:00	Comparing floating point numbersFloating point numbers and NaN	\nFloating point comparisons can be a painful work to achieve. And always must one avoid laziness in doing equality comparisons using inbuilt operator== for floating point numbers.There could be roundings involved and/or infinite decimal expansions that can lead to inaccurate representations or better say, losing of some precision off the number. Owing to that, even though you would expect a number to match a definite expansion that the calculation may have lead to, it may not.An easy way to handle that is to choose a reasonable tolerance in the comparison. For example, we could choose a tolerance of 0.0000001 when comparing two doubles for equality such that the absolute value of their difference if less than this value then, you could consider them to be equal or better say, 'close enough' for most reasonable cases. This tolerance can, however, be insufficient if:    1) The numbers are very large or if the numbers are very small in value for the tolerance to be able to compare to their difference.    2) If there have been multiple arithematic operations performed that could lead to compounded incorrectness (owing to multiple roundings/loss of precision involved) in the result.In C++, there is a value std::numeric_limits::epsilon() that is referred to sometimes as machine epsilon value/tolerance or machine accuracy. It gives the difference between 1 and the smallest value greater than 1 that is representable for data type for which the template's instantiated, which is double here. This helps us with the standardization of the tolerance value that we previously had chosen as 0.0000001. But doesn't help us with the limitations 1) and 2) pointed out above.There could more factors than that mentioned in 2) that can cause the rounding error. Apart from arithematic operations, it could be type promotions or binary conversions that can cause more than epsilon() rounding error. So, combination of 2 arithematic operations could lead to more than 2*epsilon. I don't know how quantifiable that is, but by a safer choice of N (number of arithematic operations involved), we hope to be able to overcome the problem in most practical cases. :-)For the short-coming mentioned in 1), we would need to bring the epsilon to the degree of large-ness or small-ness of the numbers involved. Considering this, you might have something like:templatebool fequal(T x, T y, int N){    T diff = std::abs(x-y);    T tolerance = N*std::numeric_limits::epsilon(); //caters to 2)    return (diff 	Learning C++	http://learningcppisfun.blogspot.co.il/2010/04/comparing-floating-point-numbers.html	Article	3

They change it and see what the computer does. They repeat the process again and again until they figure out how the box works. A long time ago, back when DOS ruled the world, back before the World Wide Web, back when I was teaching myself BASIC… we typed code out by hand.

332	2017-02-08 21:14:07	When to Define Action Creators in Redux	Redux is often criticized for requiring a lot of boilerplate code to make anything happen. One of the primary offenders is the action creator – a function that exists solely to return a plain object. They often seem like excessive abstraction for the sake of abstraction. This post will go over why action creators exist, why they’re worth using, and when you can skip them.	Dave Ceddia	https://daveceddia.com//redux-action-creators/	Article	27

391	2017-01-07 00:00:00	A Monthly Release Cadence: Releasing December and January RC	Shortly after React Native was introduced, we started releasing every two weeks to help the community adopt new features, while keeping versions stable for production use. At Facebook we had to stabilize the codebase every two weeks for the release of our production iOS apps, so we decided to release the open source versions at the same pace. Now, many of the Facebook apps ship once per week, especially on Android. Because we ship from master weekly, we need to keep it quite stable. So the bi-weekly release cadence doesn't even benefit internal contributors anymore.	Facebook	http://facebook.github.io//react-native/blog/2017/01/07/monthly-release-cadence.html	Article	64

377	2015-07-26 16:03:45	Handle DOM Events the Angular Way Without jQuery	One of the difficulties many newcomers to Angular face is that they’re used to “thinking in jQuery.” Angular requires a new way of thinking about building applications, a more systematic approach than the patchy/hacky style that jQuery promotes. Let me just put an asterisk on that “without jQuery” in the title, though: Angular ships with something it calls “jqLite”, which is essentially a stripped-down version of jQuery. When you use angular.element, that’s invoking jqLite.	Dave Ceddia	https://daveceddia.com//angular/handle-dom-events-the-angular-way-without-jquery/	Article	27

2577	2016-07-27 00:00:00	Higher Order Components: A React Application Design Pattern	In this article we will discuss how to use Higher Order Components to keep your React applications tidy, well structured and easy to maintain. We’ll discuss how pure functions keep code clean and how these same principles can be applied to React components.\r\n\r\nPure Functions\r\n\r\nA function is considered pure if it adheres to the following properties:\r\n\r\n\r\nAll the data it deals with are declared as arguments\r\n\r\nIt does not mutate data it was given or any other data (these are often referred to as side effects).\r\n\r\nGiven the same input, it will always return the same output.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor example, the add function below is pure:\r\n\r\nfunction add(x, y) {\r\n  return x + y;\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, the function badAdd below is impure:\r\n\r\nvar y = 2;\r\nfunction badAdd(x) {  \r\n  return x + y;\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\nThis function is not pure because it references data that it hasn’t directly been given. As a result, it’s possible to call this function with the same input and get different output:\r\n\r\nvar y = 2;\r\nbadAdd(3) // 5\r\ny = 3;\r\nbadAdd(3) // 6\r\n\r\n\r\nTo read more about pure functions you can read “An introduction to reasonably pure programming” by Mark Brown.\r\n\r\nWhilst pure functions are very useful, and make debugging and testing an application much easier, occasionally you will need to create impure functions that have side effects, or modify the behavior of an existing function that you are unable to access directly (a function from a library, for example). To enable this we need to look at higher order functions.\r\n\r\nHigher Order Functions\r\n\r\nA higher order function is a function that when called, returns another function. Often they also take a function as an argument, but this is not required for a function to be considered higher order.\r\n\r\nLet’s say we have our add function from above, and we want to write some code so that when we call it we log the result to the console before returning the result. We’re unable to edit the add function, so instead we can create a new function:\r\n\r\nfunction addAndLog(x, y) {  \r\n  var result = add(x, y);\r\n  console.log('Result', result);\r\n  return result;\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\nWe decide that logging results of functions is useful, and now we want to do the same with a subtract function. Rather than duplicate the above, we could write a higher order function that can take a function and return a new function that calls the given function and logs the result before then returning it:\r\n\r\nfunction logAndReturn(func) {  \r\n  return function() {  \r\n    var args = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments);\r\n    var result = func.apply(null, args);\r\n    console.log('Result', result);\r\n    return result;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\nNow we can take this function and use it to add logging to add and subtract:\r\n\r\nvar addAndLog = logAndReturn(add);\r\naddAndLog(4, 4) // 8 is returned, ‘Result 8’ is logged\r\n\r\nvar subtractAndLog = logAndReturn(subtract);\r\nsubtractAndLog(4, 3) // 1 is returned, ‘Result 1’ is logged;\r\n\r\n\r\nlogAndReturn is a HOF because it takes a function as its argument and returns a new function that we can call. These are really useful for wrapping existing functions that you can’t change in behavior. For more information on this, check M. David Green’s article “Higher-Order Functions in JavaScript which goes into much more detail on the subject. \r\n\r\nAdditionally you can check out this CodePen, which shows the above code in action.\r\n\r\nHigher Order Components\r\n\r\nMoving into React land, we can use the same logic as above to take existing React components and give them some extra behaviours.\r\n\r\nIn this section we're going to use React Router, the de facto routing solution for React. If you'd like to get started with the library I highly recommend the React Router Tutorial on GitHub.\r\n\r\nReact Router’s Link component\r\n\r\nReact Router provides a  component that is used to link between pages in a React application. One of the properties that this  component takes is activeClassName. When a  has this property and it is currently active (the user is on a URL that the link points to), the component will be given this class, enabling the developer to style it.\r\n\r\nThis is a really useful feature, and in our hypothetical application we decide that we always want to use this property. However, after doing so we quickly discover that this is making all our  components very verbose:\r\n\r\nHome\r\nAbout\r\nContact\r\n\r\n\r\nNotice that we are having to repeat the class name property every time. Not only does this make our components verbose, it also means that if we decide to change the class name we’ve got to do it in a lot of places.

2582	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Demystifying React Components State	React is the new kid on the block, which means that not many people have any real-world experience of building something with it. This article will focus on components state and when to use them.\r\n\r\nAn example will be used as the basis for our exploration. A simple blog with a list of categories which when clicked display a list of articles. Data will be hard-coded to begin with, while later we'll use Socket.IO to simulate external article publication.\r\n\r\nStateless Children, Stateful Parent\r\n\r\nLet’s start this article by citing what the React documentation says about this topic:\r\n\r\n\r\n  A common pattern is to create several stateless components that just render data, and have a stateful component above them in the hierarchy that passes its state to its children via props.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow do we begin to implement this pattern? Phrasing it another way, the pattern involves a hierarchy of parent and child components.\r\n\r\nEach component will be in a separate file to enhance modularity. We’ll use Browserify to:\r\n\r\n\r\n deliver one bundled JavaScript file to the browser\r\n prevent global namespace pollution (i.e. on the window object in case of the browser)\r\n support CommonJS modules (i.e. module.exports that we see in Node.js code)\r\n\r\n\r\nLet’s start our example looking at the bottom of the hierarchy by identifying the ideal candidates for stateless child components.

2588	2015-02-23 00:00:00	3 JavaScript Libraries to Keep an Eye on in 2015	As developers, we all know that our industry evolves at a very fast pace. So fast, indeed, that it’s often hard to keep up with all the new libraries, frameworks and new versions of the tools we use on a daily basis. Still, it’s important to stay as up to date as possible. Doing so ensures that we remain productive and in line with the expectations of our bosses and clients.\r\n\r\nThe new year started more than a month ago and some trends have already started to take shape. In this article, I’ll cover three libraries and frameworks worth keeping an eye on in 2015.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReact.js\r\n\r\nReact.js, sometimes referred to as simply React, is a JavaScript library for creating user interfaces, and was created by a collaboration between Facebook and Instagram. Currently, it’s maintained by these two companies with the help of other developers, and it’s used by companies like Yahoo, Airbnb, Sony and (of course) Facebook and Instagram.\r\n\r\nReact.js isn’t a complete framework, so it doesn’t provide all the components you’ll find in other projects like Ember or AngularJS. It encourages the creation of reusable UI components, which present data that changes over time. Many people like to refer to React as the V in MVC. An important difference with frameworks like AngularJS – which uses a two-way data binding model – is that React features a one-way data binding model.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important concepts of this project is the virtual DOM. You can think of it as a set of elements that you can modify with your data and which, in the end, will modify the page’s real DOM. The virtual DOM is used for efficient re-rendering of the DOM by using a diff algorithm that only re-renders the components changed. This in turn enables the library to be ultra fast.\r\n\r\nAnother great feature is that it can also render on the server using Node.js. Therefore, you can use the same knowledge you’ve gained both on the client and on the server. This has major performance and SEO benefits. Many developers are using React.js to render a first, static version of the page on the server, which is faster than doing so on the client and is also SEO-friendly. Then they enable fast user interactions and UI updates by using React.js on the client side.\r\n\r\nThis is just a brief introduction to this library, and I really encourage you to learn more by visiting the React.js website. It contains a lot of useful tutorials that will help you in the learning process.	Sitepoint	https://www.sitepoint.com/3-javascript-libraries-keep-eye-2015/	Article	27
